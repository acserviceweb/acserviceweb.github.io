<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price excellent however Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<h3>Air Condition Service in Highlands TX</h3>
<p>Recently, Target told reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the initial intrusion into its systems was traced back to network credentials that were stolen from a 3rd party supplier. Sources now inform KrebsOnSecurity that the vendor in question was a refrigeration, heating and air  conditioning subcontractor that has operated at a variety of areas at Target and other top sellers.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have an alternative for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. Once the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively cure and solidify-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time repairing the problem, all the while explaining whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
