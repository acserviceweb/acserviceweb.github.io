<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. When they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floors and connected them into a hot water supply, glowing heat systems have actually been around since the days of the Romans. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and an elementary pumping machine to flow warm water that warmed their stone floors.

<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the main problem. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the cooling individually for each room. However, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
