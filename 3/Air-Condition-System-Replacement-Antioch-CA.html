<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Issues in Antioch CA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment.

<h3>Installation of HVAC in Antioch CA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
