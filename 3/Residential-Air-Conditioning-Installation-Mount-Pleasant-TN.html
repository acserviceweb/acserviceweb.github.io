<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
