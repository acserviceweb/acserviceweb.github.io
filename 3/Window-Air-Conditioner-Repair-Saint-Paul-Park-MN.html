<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Since it exhausts warm air out the top, do not position the condenser under a deck or completely confine it. Any air flow restriction will reduce the system's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>

<p>There are a couple of main points that homeowners will want to think about when deciding which of the best AC units they ought to set up in their homes. It actually depends on what you value the most in a top brand central air conditioner. The significant aspects for most property owners will be the overall cost to set up the best a/c brand names, lifespan of the AC unit, warranties provided, energy efficiency (SEER ratings), and size of the system you require for your house's square footage (LOTS) to effectively cool your house.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
