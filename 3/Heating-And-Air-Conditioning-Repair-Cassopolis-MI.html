<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
