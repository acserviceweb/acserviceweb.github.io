<p>A specialized air conditioning system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard ac system in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the same air course. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the exact same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is really heated up, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
