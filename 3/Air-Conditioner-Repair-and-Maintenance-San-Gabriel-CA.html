<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- give All Vovo a call! Heatpump work very well in temperate environments like King and South Snohomish counties. Running on electrical energy, a heat pump is a cost-effective service utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, but in reverse. Rather of warming or cooling the air currently inside your house, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and pushes it through the ventilation system of your house.<p>
<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. Because approximately 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless unit has a built-in efficiency advantage. Since they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Because an unit is set up in each room or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>
