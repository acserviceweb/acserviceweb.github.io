<p>Prior to you go out and purchase an a/c, there are a couple of things to decide initially. Where are you going to be installing the a/c? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to install some or go ductless? How large should the air conditioning system be? Too big and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning unit and reduce its life. Too little and your a/c unit will not have the ability to cool your home appropriately. When going shopping for a brand-new AC system, these are simply a few of the aspects that you require to take into account. Each option can and will significantly impact your system's efficiency, which is why you can't afford to ignore any of them.<p>
<p>Think about an entire house dehumidifier if your single stage air conditioner isn't old enough to validate replacement. By installing dehumidification equipment inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy a few of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without changing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, improving indoor air quality and enabling higher comfort at higher temperatures.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, however it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there are in a space or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have an unfavorable effect on occupants-- outdoors air needs to be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
