<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives ask for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, a number of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Standing water in humidifiers, air conditioning systems, on roofings and in boiler pans can end up being polluted with fungi or germs and need to be removed, also.
