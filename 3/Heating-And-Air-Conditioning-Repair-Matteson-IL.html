<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>

<h3>Check Out Ductwork At Matteson IL Commercial Buildings</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even small window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
