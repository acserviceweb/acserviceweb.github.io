<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>PE companies tend to run with the goal of selling or spinning off a company eventually. This could be through a public offering, a sale to a big service in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management. Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, earlier this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for 3 years prior to that.<p>
