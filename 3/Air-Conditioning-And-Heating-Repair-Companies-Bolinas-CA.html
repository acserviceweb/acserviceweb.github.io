<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps at Bolinas CA</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present pattern in home construction is to decrease air leakage through cracks and other openings in walls, roofings, and floors.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air helps and dilutes indoor impurities exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>There's a big difference between the heat transfer of radiation and the other typical type of house heating-- convection.

Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the rooms for the warm air to keep the walls, ceilings and floorings heated. In turn, the objects in the room, like furnishings and people, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>
