<h3>An Overview of Central Heating Systems in Puckett MS</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a recommendation in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
