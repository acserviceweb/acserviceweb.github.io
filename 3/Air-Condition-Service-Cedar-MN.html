<p>My oldest boy always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it actually didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really consider anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
