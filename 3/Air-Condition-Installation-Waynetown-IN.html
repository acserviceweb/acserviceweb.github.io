<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash can be found in on a monthly basis, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to provide auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract..
