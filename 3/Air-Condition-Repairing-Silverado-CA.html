<h3>What to Consider When Buying a Heat Pump in Silverado CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. In many cases, determined particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
