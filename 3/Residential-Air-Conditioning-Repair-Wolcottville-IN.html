<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Wolcottville IN Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging long trenches or deep holes to install the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll conserve cash over the long term since of the lower energy costs. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as standard air-source units. The lack of moving parts means you're less likely to spend huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years. They're considerably more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
