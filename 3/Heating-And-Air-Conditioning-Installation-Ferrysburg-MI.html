<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not use auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature of the floor. All wiring for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is unblocked and dry.<p>
<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot next to the radiators. This typically results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your house escape out of the window. Radiant heat provides warmth from the flooring up throughout the space with no cold spots or stuffiness in the area being warmed.<p>
