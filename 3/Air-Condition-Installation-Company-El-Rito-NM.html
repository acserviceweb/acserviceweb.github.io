<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of furnaces have several control panel. The largest, or just one in some heaters, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards collaborate the operation and control of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more.
