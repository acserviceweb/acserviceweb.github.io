Needless to state, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the harder it is for your lungs to eliminate them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside your home or outdoors - can make it increasingly hard for your lungs to function appropriately, and can have negative health impacts.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as constructing materials, home furnishings, and household items like air fresheners, release contaminants basically constantly. Other sources, associated to activities carried out in the home, release contaminants periodically. These include smoking, the use of malfunction-ing or unvented ranges, furnaces, or area heaters, the use of solvents in cleaning and pastime activities, the use of paint strippers in refurnishing activities, and using cleaning items and pesticides in house cleaning. High toxin concentrations can remain in the air for extended periods after some of these activities.<p>
