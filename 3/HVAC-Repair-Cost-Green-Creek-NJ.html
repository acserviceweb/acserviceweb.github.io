<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
