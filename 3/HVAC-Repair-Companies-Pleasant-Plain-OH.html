<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Hints to Help You Hire Pleasant Plain OH Professionals for Air Conditioning Repair</h3>
<p>Everybody deal with a range of threats to our health as we set about our everyday lives. Driving in vehicles, flying in aircrafts, engaging in leisure activities, and being exposed to environmental pollutants all position differing degrees of threat. Some dangers are merely unavoidable. Some we choose to accept because to do otherwise would restrict our capability to lead our lives the way we desire. If we had the opportunity to make informed options, and some are dangers we might decide to prevent. Indoor air pollution is one risk that you can do something about.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not use them.. Secondly like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to properly service and the unit has been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
