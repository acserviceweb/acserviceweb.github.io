<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power ought to not exceed the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems greater than the outside capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect much better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the very same time, because the overall capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Basically, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that some of the spaces may not have a really comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not easy, given that it considers not only the small power of the units, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
