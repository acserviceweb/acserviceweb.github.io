Similar to other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). COP rates just how much heat a system removes or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling result.
