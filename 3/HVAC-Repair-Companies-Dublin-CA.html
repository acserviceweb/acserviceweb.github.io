<p>When mounting a wall sensing unit, consider the height at which they must be positioned.

For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the highest concentrations inside structures are normally near the ceiling. On the other hand, ozone is heavier than air and remains near the floor.<p>
