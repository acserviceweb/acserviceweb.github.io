<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in Riverton UT</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Filters can get filthy quickly, particularly if you live in an area that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all type of dust, debris, bacteria, and tidy the air. They are accountable for preserving the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will eventually stop carrying out as you anticipate it to if they're not cleaned and changed regularly. The heating and cooling will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will intensify. Checking and changing the air filters is one of the most crucial elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they give me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
