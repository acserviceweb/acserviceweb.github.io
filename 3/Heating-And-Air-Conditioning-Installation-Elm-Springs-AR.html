<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the main issue. While setting up a different split system, workers try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more troubles, since some of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each space.
