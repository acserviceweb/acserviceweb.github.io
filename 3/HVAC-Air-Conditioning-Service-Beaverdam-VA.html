<p>The most dangerous asbestos fibers are too little to be noticeable. After they are breathed in, they can accumulate and remain in the lungs. Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be deadly). Signs of these illness do not show up until several years after exposure started. Many people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to raised concentrations on the task; some industrialized disease from direct exposure to clothing and devices brought home from task sites.<p>
