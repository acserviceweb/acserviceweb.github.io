<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor system as near the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)
