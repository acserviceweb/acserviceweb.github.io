<h3>The Most Frequent Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>

After checking 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
