We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same contaminants. In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>It is especially crucial to take as a number of these steps as possible while you are associated with short-term activities that can produce high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint removing, heating with kerosene heating systems, cooking, or participating in maintenance and hobby activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding.

This implies that devices that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
