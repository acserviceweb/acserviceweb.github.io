<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>The main factor house owners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the amount of services used.
