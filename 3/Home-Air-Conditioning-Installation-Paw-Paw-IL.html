<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heater, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable concepts.

<p>A specialized a/c unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard a/c unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the same air path.
