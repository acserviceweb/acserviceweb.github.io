<h3>Benefits of Purchasing on Gas Furnaces in Vallonia IN</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his assessment, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
