<p>I have been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a tough task that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps guys working. When a sales male concerns your house he exists to sell, that is the only method he is paid. You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and must not "require" to offer you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I provide you the alternatives for your needs and you decide if you need it.<p>

<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Dunkirk IN</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  unit instead of ducting air straight from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
