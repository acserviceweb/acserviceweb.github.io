Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by individuals and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander.

Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
