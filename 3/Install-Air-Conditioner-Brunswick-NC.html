<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space.

The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
