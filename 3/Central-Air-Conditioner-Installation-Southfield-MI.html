<h3>Natural Gas Furnace Service in Southfield Michigan</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the go to. They advised changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was really delighted they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will certainly be utilizing them once again.<p>

The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future.
