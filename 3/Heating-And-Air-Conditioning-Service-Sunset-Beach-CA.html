<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Convected heat systems have been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floorings and connected them into a hot water supply. Romans utilized a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and a primary pumping device to flow hot water that warmed their stone floorings. In turn, the uniformity of the floor heat transferred heat to other posts in the spaces, including the human residents.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a range of different heater, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
