<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

Dripping return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
