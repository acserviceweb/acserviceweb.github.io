<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place two 2x4s below the box to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>
<p>A/c unit manufacturers typically make rugged, high quality products. Begin by examining any merges or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the system cool off for about five minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limit switch might have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, situated in the compressor's access panel.<p>
