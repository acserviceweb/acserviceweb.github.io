<p>They were fantastic! Numerous HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially asked for. They satisfied my requirements entirely by offering an expert quote with alternatives, without pressing additional products. The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The likewise quickly followed up with the required assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO preserve the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor carefully, a number of the 'respectable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a reputable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roofing, is most commonly used on commercial structures, however it is also an alternative for house owners to think about. Often times, these units consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, considering that the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are generally just readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a great way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the best option for homeowners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
