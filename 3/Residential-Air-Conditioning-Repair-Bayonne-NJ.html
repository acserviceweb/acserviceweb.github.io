<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

There are a number of approaches for making HVAC systems more effective.<p>
