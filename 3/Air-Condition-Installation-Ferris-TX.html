<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay.

Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners should pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>
