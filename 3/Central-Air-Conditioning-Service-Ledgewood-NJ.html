<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
