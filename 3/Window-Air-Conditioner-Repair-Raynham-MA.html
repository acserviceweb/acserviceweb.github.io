<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as developed. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperature levels (style levels), instead of the higher temperature levels in some cases utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to supply thermal comfort indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors creates the need for careful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities give rise to mold development and wetness inside is associated with a higher frequency of resident breathing issues.<p>

<h3>Different types of HVAC Repairs in Raynham MA</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present trend in home building is to decrease air leakage through cracks and other openings in floors, roofs, and walls. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
