<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product in time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
