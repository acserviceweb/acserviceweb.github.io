<p>Immediate results might show up after a single exposure or duplicated exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such immediate results are normally short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is just removing the individual's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified. Symptoms of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may likewise show up soon after exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Lastly, if you do determine an especially energy-efficient in-floor heater and choose to install it in your house, you could be qualified for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor costs.

<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For example, humans exhale co2, which in small quantities is not poisonous, but might become hazardous if high concentrations are allowed to accumulate. Germs or micro-organisms may also exist within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do establish, they may spread out throughout the whole workplace or building by methods of the ventilation system.<p>
