<h3>Assessing Commercial Boilers to Residential Boilers at Ravenna MI</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing trend in house building and construction is to minimize air leakage through fractures and other openings in walls, floors, and roofing systems. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
