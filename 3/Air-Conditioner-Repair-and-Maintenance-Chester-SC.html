<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
