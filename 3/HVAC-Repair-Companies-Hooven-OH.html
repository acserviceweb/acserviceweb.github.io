<p>I have been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company.

<p>Healthcare facility running theatres, in which air is filtered to high levels to lower infection risk and the humidity managed to limit patient dehydration. Although temperatures are often in the comfort variety, some expert treatments, such as open heart surgery, need low temperatures (about 18 ° C, 64 ° F) and others, such as neonatal, fairly high temperatures (about 28 ° C, 82 ° F). In both comfort and procedure applications, the objective may be to not just manage temperature level, but also humidity, air quality, and air motion from area to space.<p>
<p>Examine these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The minimized airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>
