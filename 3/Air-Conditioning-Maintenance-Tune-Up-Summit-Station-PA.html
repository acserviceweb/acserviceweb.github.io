<p>The heatpump gained popularity in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heatpump can extract heat from various sources, such as environmental air, exhaust air from a structure, or from the ground. Heat pumps move heat from outside the structure into the air within. At first, heatpump HVAC systems were just used in moderate environments, however with improvements in low temperature level operation and reduced loads due to more effective homes, they are increasing in appeal in cooler climates.<p>
<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the ac system into a heat pump While space air conditioning supplies maximum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is normally more expensive than central air.<p>
