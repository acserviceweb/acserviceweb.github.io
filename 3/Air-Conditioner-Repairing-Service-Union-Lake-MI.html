Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's supply of water, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is used for producing power in the form of electrical power. The two operations use various procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be warmed to boiling point to accomplish its aims.<p>
