<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have actually been effectively dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. If products with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
