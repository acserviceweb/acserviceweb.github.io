<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, however to have two significant parts stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by warranty.
