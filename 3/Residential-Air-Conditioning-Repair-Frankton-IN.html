HVAC experts suggest following this basic rule when choosing whether it's worth buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a new system, it's finest to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than necessary.<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
