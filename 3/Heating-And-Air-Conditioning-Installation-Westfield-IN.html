(If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
