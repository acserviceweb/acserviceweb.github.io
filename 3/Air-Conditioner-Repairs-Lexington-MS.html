<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding sounds. Though most air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems may be belt-driven. Screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler usually take place when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. In many cases, the belt is incorrectly lined up or worn and requires replacement. Follow the directions above under Air conditioning system Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>
