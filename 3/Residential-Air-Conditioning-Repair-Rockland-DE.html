<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash can be found in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year.
