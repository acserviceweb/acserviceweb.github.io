<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to properly service and the unit has actually been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
