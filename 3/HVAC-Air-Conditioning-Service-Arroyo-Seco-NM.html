<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.  Second of all like prolonged car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ.

Lastly discovered someone to effectively service and the system has actually been operating issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
