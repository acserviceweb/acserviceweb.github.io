<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
