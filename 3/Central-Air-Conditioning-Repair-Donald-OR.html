<p>Strategy on investing several thousand dollars for the total system if you are thinking about installing a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your house. The size of the system identifies the labor hours involved to build the system.

<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more challenging to control than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity ought to be kept at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they give me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
