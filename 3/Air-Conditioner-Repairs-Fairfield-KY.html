<h3>Ductless Heat Pump in Fairfield KY</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
