<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in every month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to offer car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There need to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
