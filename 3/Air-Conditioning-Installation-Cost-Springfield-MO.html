<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood floor joist system, underneath the wooded subsurface and final flooring surface. This is normally utilized in a third-floor or second area and takes advantage of the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional thickness of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber radiant flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
