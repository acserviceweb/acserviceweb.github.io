<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
