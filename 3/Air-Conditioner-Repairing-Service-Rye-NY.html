In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
