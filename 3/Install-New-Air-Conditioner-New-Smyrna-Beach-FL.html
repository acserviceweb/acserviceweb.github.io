<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source.
