Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
