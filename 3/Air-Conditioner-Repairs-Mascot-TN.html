<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have concerns, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
