There have actually been awkward sounds. I got it checked and fixed. I am hoping that is the end of the concern. In general, it has actually been a great experience. Dependable on the whole. Cool operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its appearances in the beginning. However then recognized ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was essential and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the water heater due to the fact that the service technicians thought they simply didn't seem right and they could not leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
