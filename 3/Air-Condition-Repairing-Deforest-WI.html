<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- give All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work very well in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Working on electrical power, a heat pump is a cost-efficient solution using a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, but in reverse. Instead of warming or cooling the air already inside your home, it draws heat or cool from the air exterior and presses it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
