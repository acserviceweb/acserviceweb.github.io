<p>A packaged system, generally set up on the roof, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, however it is also a choice for property owners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are great for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, considering that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are generally just offered for larger houses due to their high power and capability.
