<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c unit works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
