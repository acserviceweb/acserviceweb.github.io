The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems may be belt-driven.

<p>. Prior to choosing the installation location of a/c, several main elements require to be thought about. First off, the direction of air flow from the indoor units should not fall on the place of rest or work area.

The outdoor unit should likewise be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from the house will not be effectively released outdoors and the productivity of the whole system will drop sharply.

<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service many years ago and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
