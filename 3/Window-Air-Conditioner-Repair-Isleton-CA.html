<p>A hydronic radiant floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipelines set up under the floor or right within the floor surface area itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the flooring mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and people. It does not rely on heating or moving air to transfer warmth.<p>
