<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
