Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
