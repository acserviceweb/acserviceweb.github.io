<h3>Heating System Installation in Butler Maryland</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either since of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
