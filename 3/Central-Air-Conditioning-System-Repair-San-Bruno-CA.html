<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
