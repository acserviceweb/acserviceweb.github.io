Load calculating is described as the Handbook J estimation and must be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to offering an installation or unit cost for cooling. If your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square footage alone, transfer to another contractor.

The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
