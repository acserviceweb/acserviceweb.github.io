He knew just what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in.
