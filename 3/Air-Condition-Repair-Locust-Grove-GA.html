<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the primary problem. While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, since a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>
