<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning unit back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging material to safeguard it from damage.

And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be serious.
