<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance at Locust Dale VA</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely pleased that someone as experienced as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to check the ac system prior to you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to test AC units even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
