<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based just on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of reasonable ones received. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier.

<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Since it exhausts warm air out the top, don't put the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it. Any air flow constraint will reduce the system's performance. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and accreditations. An excellent place to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) accreditation. It's kind of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, however a great deal of contractors out there haven't troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Structure Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Managers with BPI certification know that the house is a system and see HVAC equipment as simply one aspect (out of many) of a comfortable environment.<p>
