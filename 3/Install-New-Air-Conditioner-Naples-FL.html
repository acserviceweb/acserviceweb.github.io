The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.<p>
