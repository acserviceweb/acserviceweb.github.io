<p>Home heating unit are made complex systems that require the services of a contractor to set up. While you can definitely purchase your furnace yourself, the majority of contractors won't guarantee the furnace or may not install it if you don't purchase it from them.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>
