<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, class or lab environments, instead of industrial or outdoor settings. In tasks where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit.

But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
