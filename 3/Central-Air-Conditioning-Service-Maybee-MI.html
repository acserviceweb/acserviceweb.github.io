<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Important Company in Los Angeles. Switched to using Wachoff's about a year earlier and they've been to the house for a system tune-up 3 times now. They're priced fairly, have handled the one repair I needed well, and are professional and always on-time.

<p>The first air conditioning unit and fridges used poisonous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could result in fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
