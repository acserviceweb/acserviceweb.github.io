<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to offer car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
