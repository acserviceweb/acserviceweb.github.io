<p>My eldest child always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think of anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is itâ and low $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, however it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have a negative impact on residents-- outside air needs to be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
