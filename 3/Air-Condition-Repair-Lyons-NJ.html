Depending upon the kind of unit set up, it can be loud and trigger problems if you're extremely adverse dust. In addition, particular fuels and equipment might need special licenses, and there is restricted flexibility in case of changed heating requirements.

<p>Air contaminants can vary from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your family pets to unsafe gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a common air contaminant arising from gas that gets away into your home without being burnt. Older homes might include asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In kitchen areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can end up being a problem where wetness levels are normally higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is filthy, and filters are plugged, and possibly refrigerant is low, it will not be working at optimal efficiency and could get too hot.

It's possible that the size of AC unit you have is not huge enough for your house. If the system is too little, it will have to work more difficult and may get too hot. Usually, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to set up a 5-ton system for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot home.<p>
