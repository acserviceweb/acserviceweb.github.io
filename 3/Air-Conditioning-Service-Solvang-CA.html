Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
