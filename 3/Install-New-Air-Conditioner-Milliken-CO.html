We had purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to test the air conditioning unit before you buy.

<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ might observe moldy or unpleasant smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>
