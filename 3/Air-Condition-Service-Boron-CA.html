<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants.

As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
