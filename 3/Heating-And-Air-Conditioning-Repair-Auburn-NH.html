<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
