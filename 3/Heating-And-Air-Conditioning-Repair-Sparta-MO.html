<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your house that perfect temperature all year round.

Review of this data might identify potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are really low, keeping an eye on data may not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
