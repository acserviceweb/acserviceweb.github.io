<h3>Working of a HVAC System at Buffalo MN</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heater. We picked getting something more costly than a standard water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
