<p>Central air systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
