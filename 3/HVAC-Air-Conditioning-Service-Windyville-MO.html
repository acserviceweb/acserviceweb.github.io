<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
