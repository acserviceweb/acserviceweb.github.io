<p>The most dangerous asbestos fibers are too small to be visible. After they are inhaled, they can collect and stay in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be deadly). Symptoms of these diseases do not show up till many years after direct exposure began. Most people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to raised concentrations on the job; some industrialized illness from direct exposure to clothes and equipment brought home from task websites.<p>

<h3>Heating Duct in Richland MO</h3>
<p>Lots of commercial structures use mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that are part of the heating and HVAC systems. Some structures can also use natural ventilation by opening doors or windows. The ventilation rate" is the quantity of outside air presented into a space per a system of time, and is frequently revealed in cubic feet per minute (cfm). You can discover the ASHRAE (American Society of Refrigerating, heating and air-conditioning Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for acceptable air quality online.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are specifically at threat. EPA estimates that direct exposure to secondhand smoke increases the variety of episodes and seriousness of signs in numerous countless asthmatic kids, and may trigger countless nonasth-matic children to establish the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition intensified by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke causes nose, eye, and throat irritation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually connected direct exposure to pre-owned smoke with the onset of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more tough to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside should be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
