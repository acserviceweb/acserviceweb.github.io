<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Disease (BRI) describes less regular (but often more severe) cases of individuals ending up being ill after being in a particular structure at a certain time. In these cases, there is usually a similar set of scientific signs experienced by the people and a clear cause can often be found upon investigation. Legionnaires Disease is an example of BRI caused by bacteria which can infect a structure's cooling system.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a big central air conditioner unit that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps work on electrical energy and work like a/c in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This permits them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating unit (like a space heating unit) with the same quantity of electricity. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't provide agreements.  The so called respectable companies swindle more people than the fly by night outfits. I understand because I attempted to work for them. Since 90% of them are criminals, I give up. They stroll in with or without an agreement and start offering you things you do not need. They lie. How do I know. I now work as an expert to verify the so called problems and treatments. 9 out of 10, I examine are entirely incorrect.<p>
<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers utilized various methodologies. The CMHC study called on several duct-cleaning services. The companies were not warned they were part of a study, and the scientists did not control for time invested or approaches utilized. The EPA study recommended and managed techniques used on a smaller variety of houses. While the duct-cleaning market argues both research studies have flaws, no other research has actually challenged the findings. And although the equipment and methods utilized by duct-cleaning companies have actually changed given that these studies were carried out, the air ducts in homes haven't.<p>
<p>Firstly, The after hours answering service agent, John, was really respectful and expert. Second Of All, Gracion W is a timely, educated technician. He was at my home within the time he offered me, fixed the problem while explaining the concern then remained several minutes to make sure it was working effectively. The problem was fixed in a matter of time that I've never seen before while being a house owner for 10 years. I also recommend among the Protection Plans, which I belong to, if you like to conserve money. Thank you." Karen P.<p>
