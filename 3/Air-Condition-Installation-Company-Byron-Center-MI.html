<p>Last week, Target informed reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the initial intrusion into its systems was traced back to network credentials that were taken from a 3rd party supplier. Sources now inform KrebsOnSecurity that the supplier in question was a refrigeration, air and heating  conditioning subcontractor that has operated at a number of locations at Target and other top sellers.<p>

<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your home that perfect temperature level all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those common air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job.

So, make certain to change your AC filters frequently, or get a cooling service strategy which typically consists of a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
