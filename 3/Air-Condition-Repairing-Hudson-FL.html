<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals used in the construction or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these home appliances (cook stoves, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor pollutants.

<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO maintain the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, a lot of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>This review is for replacing a 17 years of age AC with a new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who discussed our choices did an outstanding job in making sure we understood the advantages and disadvantages of each option. The professionals who set up the new system were quick and professional, while taking time to ensure we comprehended how the brand-new system worked. In general a first rate experience.<p>
