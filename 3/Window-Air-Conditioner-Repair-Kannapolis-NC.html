<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you need to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
