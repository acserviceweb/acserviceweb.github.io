<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
