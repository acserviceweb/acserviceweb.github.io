<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
