<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to buy additional things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
