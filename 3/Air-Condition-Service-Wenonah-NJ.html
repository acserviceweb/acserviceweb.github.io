<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ might observe unpleasant or moldy smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues.

However not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to good structure management.<p>
