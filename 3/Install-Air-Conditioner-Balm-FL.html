<p>I generally do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for residence residents. Unlike other kinds of air conditioning system, evaporative coolers depend on the outside air to be funnelled through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the inside of a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air should be permitted to push the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to maintain and understand.<p>
