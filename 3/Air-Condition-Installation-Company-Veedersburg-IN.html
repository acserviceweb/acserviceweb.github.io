<p>This is especially significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>A third method to choose whether your house may have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, look for indications of issues with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can indicate your home may not have adequate ventilation include wetness condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or foul-smelling air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other items become moldy. To spot smells in your house, action outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether odors are noticeable.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in adequate outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
