<p>Current Review: They were fantastic! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They met my requirements completely by offering an expert quote with choices, without pushing additional products. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The also quickly followed up with the required assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, often referred to as central air" or split-system a/c", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the floors, walls, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the a/c unit to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
