<p>Regular maintenance keeps a furnace working effectively, according to HVAC experts like Dave Mejean of B&W Pipes & Heating in Indianapolis.

<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location. All things in the hot zone reach balance in temperature level after the convected heat system has actually been operating for a while, including individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
