<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime. Connection issues along the line that supplies power to your furnace can compromise the performance of the unit.

<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold.

Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
