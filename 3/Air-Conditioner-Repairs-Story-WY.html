<h3>Air Conditioning And Refrigeration in Story WY</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
