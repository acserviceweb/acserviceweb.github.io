<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
