<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that same aquifer.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are prone to cold areas", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot beside the radiators.

Convected heat supplies heat from the floor up throughout the room without any cold spots or stuffiness in the area being warmed.<p>
