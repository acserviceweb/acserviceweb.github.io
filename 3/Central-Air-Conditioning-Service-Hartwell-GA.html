<p>This is especially notable, as gas ranges can trigger levels of pollution that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater.
