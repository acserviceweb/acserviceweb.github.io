Based on the average temperature levels in our location, if you compared running your furnace to an automobile it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its expected life expectancy of 15 years.

Also, housing costs in Seattle have actually skyrocketed, and as a result, more recent houses are getting taller and skinnier, with bed rooms on the upper levels.

<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge toxins.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
