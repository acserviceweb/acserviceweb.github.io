<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
