<h3>The Way to Keep Healthy Ductwork for A Healthy Home in Bremen IN</h3>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a referral later). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
