Purchased a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
