<p>Discover PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers contaminants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage performance rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A very effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-lasting efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon preserving it according to the manufacturer's directions.<p>

<p>Lead has long been recognized as a damaging environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " top environmental hazard to the health of children in the United States." There are many ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, degrading paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead gets in the body. Before it was understood how damaging lead could be, it was used in paint, gasoline, water pipes, and lots of other items.<p>

<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more difficult to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
