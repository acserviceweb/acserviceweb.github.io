An option to packaged systems is the use of separate indoor and outside coils in split systems Split systems are preferred and widely used around the world except in The United States and Canada. In The United States and Canada, divided systems are frequently seen in residential applications, however they are gaining popularity in little commercial structures.

<p>A customized air conditioning system that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic air conditioning unit in that both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the exact same air path. Due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, given that all elements of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is really heated, just as by an electric heater that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
