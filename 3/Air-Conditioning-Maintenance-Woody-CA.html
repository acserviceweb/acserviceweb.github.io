<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your home won't warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Often, however, constructing residents experience symptoms that do not fit the pattern of any specific disease and are difficult to trace to any specific phenomenon has been labeled sick building syndrome. People may complain of several of the following symptoms: dry or burning mucous membranes in the nose, eyes, and throat; sneezing; runny or stuffy nose; fatigue or sleepiness; headache; lightheadedness; nausea; irritability and forgetfulness. Poor lighting, noise, vibration, thermal pain, and psychological tension may also trigger, or contribute to, these signs.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Outside impurities. Outside particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and allergens found in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Specialists advise utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, however higher MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and generally are better for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a referral later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
