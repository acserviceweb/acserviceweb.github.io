<p>Award Winning Plumbing and HVAC Services. Many common building materials utilized prior to 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Normally, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the structure products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling. Removal of asbestos-containing products is not always ideal because the fibers can be spread into the air throughout the removal process. A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing products is typically advised instead.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system parts, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>
