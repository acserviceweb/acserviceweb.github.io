<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Montville NJ</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was essential and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the hot water heater because the service technicians thought they just didn't seem best and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
