<p>Using air filters can trap some of the air pollutants. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy area recommends that "Air Filtration need to have a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as identified by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are used to reduce the amount of dust that reaches the damp coils. Dust can serve as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can lower the effectiveness of the coils.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply eight to 10 years old, it could grovel twice the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's since it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to offer a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling costs than devices set up just a couple of years earlier.<p>
<p>Before cooling or installing any new heating system in a house, it is necessary to re examine and reduce the energy load of the home. A more energy effective home will not just decrease the cost of a brand-new system and utility bills, however it will considerably enhance the convenience of your house. Prior to we design and set up any systems, we set up a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will advise improvements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these improvements. Basic enhancements typically consist of adding insulation and air sealing steps. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can suggest a number of qualified home Energy Star auditors and installation professionals. Please Contact Us for references.<p>
