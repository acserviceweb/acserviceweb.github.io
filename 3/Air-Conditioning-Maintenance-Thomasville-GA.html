<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>The very first a/c and refrigerators utilized combustible or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could lead to fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
