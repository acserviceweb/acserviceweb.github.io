Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the greater temperature levels in some cases used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for the majority of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need more cooling to supply thermal comfort indoors.
