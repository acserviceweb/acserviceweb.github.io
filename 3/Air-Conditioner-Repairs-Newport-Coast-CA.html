What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
