<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your a/c unit is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. If it leaks, just including refrigerant is not a solution. A trained technician needs to repair any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the right quantity of refrigerant. Remember that the efficiency and efficiency of your air conditioning unit is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the manufacturer's specification, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be harmful to the environment.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up frequently, they can end up being obstructed with particles that can limit air flow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's performance. Filthy filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down completely. By contrast, checking and changing a furnace filter can normally be performed in simply a couple of minutes, frequently without any tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
