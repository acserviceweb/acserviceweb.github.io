<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
