<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, many of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Issues. HVAC systems can also intensify indoor air quality issues. The HVAC system might be contaminated (due to the fact that of mold in duct lining or germs on coil or filters, for instance), and the system might spread out these contaminants throughout the home. Second, the HVAC duct circulation system can spread out toxins from one part of the home to another. Regular maintenance and duct sealing can assist minimize these issues.<p>
