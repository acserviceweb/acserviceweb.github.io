To make certain the unit you select is the ideal size for your home, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load computation estimate to figure out the precise kind of heat and a/c system that's perfect for your home-we do not simply change it with the very same size system you currently have.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>The installation was quick, professional and effectively done. The installers were courteous and knew precisely what to do. I am an engineer by occupation and recognize easily individuals who are proficient at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are very good and do not miss detail that creates a task extremely well done. I really highly suggest the 2 gentlemen as they are excellent at what they do. Thank you to them as they definitely deserve my thanks and appreciation for a job well done.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO protect the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, many of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>In addition to the customer reviews, you can learn a lot about an HVAC company by any awards they get. There are numerous companies that strive to help inform the general public about different companies. Angie's List may award a Super Service Award to the very best HVAC company. The Better Business Bureau is a great location to check for client fulfillment. The very best HVAC company will be dedicated to making customers pleased. Hence, they might have even gotten the BBB Award for Difference, as Madd Air has several times. Many local companies who are dedicated to the best service will also be acknowledged by local companies who wish to see great company stay in the location.<p>
