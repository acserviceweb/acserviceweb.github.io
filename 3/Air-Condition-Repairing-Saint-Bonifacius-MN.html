<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for assessment and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>A health questionnaire should be developed and dispersed to all worried workers. Such a tool needs to identify the variety of people affected; define ages and task descriptions of involved employees; determine where they lie within the workplace; show when the signs take place (time of day, day of week, and time of year); supply a list of specific health signs or diseases; recognize all devices operated in the office; indicate the type of outdoors air pollution; and recognize possible sources of task tension.<p>
<p>The pollutants noted in this guide have been shown to cause the health results pointed out. However, it is not necessarily true that the results noted happen at the pollutant concentration levels generally found in the home. In most cases, our understanding of the contaminants and their health impacts is too minimal to identify the levels at which the listed results might take place.<p>
