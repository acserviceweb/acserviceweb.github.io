<p>Immediate impacts might show up after a single exposure or repeated exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such instant impacts are generally short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is just eliminating the person's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined. Symptoms of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also show up not long after exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your home that best temperature level throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those common air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can result in pricey repairs down the road. So, make sure to change your AC filters routinely, or get a cooling service strategy which typically includes a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Consider potential impacts of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating system. Follow the maker's instructions, particularly directions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating unit effectively adjusted. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is generally an indicator of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heating system remains in use, open a door from the space where the heating unit lies to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
