<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, considering that some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>

Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
