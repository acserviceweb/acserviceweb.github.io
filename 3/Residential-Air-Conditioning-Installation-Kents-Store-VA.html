Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost great however Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
