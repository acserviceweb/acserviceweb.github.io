<p>In houses, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pushed wood products made using adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood products made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furnishings); wood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard includes a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood product and is typically recognized as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood item.<p>
<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance items that just an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do.

Likewise, tidy ducts and appropriate airflow are important to a well-functioning system, however homeowners lack the required devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still needed to have a professional technician check the system regularly.<p>

While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
