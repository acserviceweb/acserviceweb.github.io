<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>1. Central Air Source Heat Pumps Air source heat pumps work best in a mild environment, where the temperature level doesn't get too low or too high. Simply put, they are ideal for our Seattle environment! They are extremely effective, beating out most other kinds of heater in efficiency. The only real exception to this would be a geothermal heatpump system. However, a geothermal installation normally costs 10s of thousands more than an air source heat pump, which generally suggests it fails in regards to return on investment.<p>
