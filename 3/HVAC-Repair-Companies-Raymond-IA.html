<p>Sean was really handy. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no issues aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was essential and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the water heater because the specialists thought they simply didn't seem right and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
