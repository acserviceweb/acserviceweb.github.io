<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
