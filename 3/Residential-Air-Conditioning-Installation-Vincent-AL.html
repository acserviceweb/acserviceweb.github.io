<h3>Working of a HVAC System in Vincent AL</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing pattern in home construction is to decrease air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofs, walls, and floorings. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air assists and waters down indoor pollutants tire them from the home.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
