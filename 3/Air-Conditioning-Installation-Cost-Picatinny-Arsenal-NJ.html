Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar.

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
