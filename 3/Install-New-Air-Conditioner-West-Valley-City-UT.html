<p>It may feel cozy being sealed in tight against the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, however for individuals who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have respiratory problems, winter season can intensify problems. Stagnant indoor air and heating unit can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing allergen, animal dander, and mold spores flowing through your house.

If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
