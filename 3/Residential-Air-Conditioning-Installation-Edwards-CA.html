<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps run on electricity and work like air conditioners in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to provide car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There must not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
