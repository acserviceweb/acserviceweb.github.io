<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
