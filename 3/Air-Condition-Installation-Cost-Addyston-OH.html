Air conditioning system assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in incredibly humid environments or in cases where the ac system is extra-large, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioning unit will need more energy to cool your home.

Installing a multi-split system creates more troubles, because some of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each space.
