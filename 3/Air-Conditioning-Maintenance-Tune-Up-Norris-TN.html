<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise apartments bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has actually viewed the single-family house installation organisation totally turn on its head the last few years. Winter season used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to as much as 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not simply with beginners more familiar with AC living. Longtime Seattle property owners are finally giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have actually found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was necessary and renovated the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater since the technicians thought they simply didn't appear right and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
