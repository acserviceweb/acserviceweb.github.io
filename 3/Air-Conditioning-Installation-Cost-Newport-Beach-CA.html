<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature level of the flooring. All circuitry for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is dry and unblocked.<p>
<p>If you are thinking about installing a central heating and air-conditioning system when you do not have one in your house, plan on investing numerous thousand dollars for the total system. The size of the system identifies the labor hours included to construct the system. To equip a house with the ductwork and vents can cost as much as the brand new furnace or more when you consider installation fees upwards of $50 per hour.<p>
<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. Once the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly treat and harden-- usually two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
