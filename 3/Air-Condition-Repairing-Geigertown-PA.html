<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
