<p>Dometic's commercial grade roof ac system are performance-tested to overcome harsh or unusual road and climate condition. Many basic systems break down after just four hours of severe vibration testing, while the Brisk II is still going strong at 30 hours and more! The galvanized steel top plate provides lasting strength while long copper lines minimize vibration and, therefore, sound too.

The likewise promptly followed up with the needed inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
