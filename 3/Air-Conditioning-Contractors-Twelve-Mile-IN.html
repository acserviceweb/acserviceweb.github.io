<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>I am an investor, I need to change 2 furnaces in a 8000square foot house. Some sources, such as constructing products, furnishings and items like air fresheners, can release contaminants more or less continually. Other sources, related to activities like smoking, cleaning, remodeling or doing hobblies release toxins periodically. Malfunctioning or unvented appliances or poorly used items can launch higher and sometimes hazardous levels of pollutants inside your home.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned frequently, they can become obstructed with particles that can restrict air flow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Dirty filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases trigger the system to close down completely. By comparison, changing a furnace and inspecting filter can generally be carried out in just a few minutes, frequently without any tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
