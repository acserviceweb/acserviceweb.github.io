<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>
