<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
