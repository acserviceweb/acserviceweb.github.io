<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same pollutants. To put it simply, sometimes the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
