<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate due to the fact that it merely takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a chance to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential wetness. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
