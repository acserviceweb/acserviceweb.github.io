<h3>Factors to Consider When Looking for a Fantastic AC Repair Company at Armona CA</h3>

Just like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE rates just how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling result.
