<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, the majority of commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which might enter neighboring ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical centers and retirement home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis.
