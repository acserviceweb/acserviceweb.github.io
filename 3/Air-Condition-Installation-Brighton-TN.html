<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely happy that somebody as skilled as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to check the air conditioning system prior to you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had methods to test AC units even in winter season. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not offer them..

Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have.

Finally found somebody to appropriately service and the system has actually been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity specialist at a big retailer who asked not to be called due to the fact that he did not have consent to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a team that routinely keeps track of energy intake and temperature levels in shops to save on costs (especially during the night) and to alert store managers if temperature levels in the shops change outside of an acceptable variety that might avoid consumers from shopping at the store.<p>
