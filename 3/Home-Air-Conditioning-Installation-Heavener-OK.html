<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the very same. Once the wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively cure and harden-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
