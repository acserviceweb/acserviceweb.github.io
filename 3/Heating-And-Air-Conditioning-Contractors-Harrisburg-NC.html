The Regulation prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).

<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business many years back and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
