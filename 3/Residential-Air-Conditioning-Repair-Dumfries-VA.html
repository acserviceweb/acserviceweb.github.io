They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they needed to order it. My partner stated that she had actually seen a terrific review for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most decent people I have met in a long period of time.

<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step.

<p>Irritants are materials that cause an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens found in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being air-borne, and thus, are easily breathed in. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you consider a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of cat allergen could induce an asthma attack in people with cat allergic reactions, however not in those individuals who do not have cat allergies.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
