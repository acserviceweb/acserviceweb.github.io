Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capability, during new building and construction (houses generally use between one and 5 heaps). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot.

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c into a heatpump While space air conditioning provides optimum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is generally more expensive than central air.<p>
