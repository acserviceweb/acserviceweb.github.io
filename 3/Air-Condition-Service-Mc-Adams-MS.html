<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to remove the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heater. We chose getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility expenses. We feel that this new system will last a long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>

Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
