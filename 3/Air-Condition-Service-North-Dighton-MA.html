During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, much of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.
