<p>We're Not Just Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to look out for is the dust that gathers during summer seasons. The very best thing to do is ensuring that the heating unit burners are checked and cleaned up thoroughly before cooler seasons begin. Always make certain that the furnace is tidied up every year to avoid soot and condensation which triggers burners to quit working appropriately. Possibly it is time to start thinking about buying a brand-new one if your furnace is in a really poor condition.<p>
<p>Place the solar storage tank near the conventional hot water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are available if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. It is most likely that it is supported by the plumbing if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. Install unions at the tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed.<p>
