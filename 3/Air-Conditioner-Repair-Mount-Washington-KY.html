<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>More typical in relatively older homes, a boiler-based heating system uses oil, electrical energy or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in individual rooms. All-electric boilers can achieve approximately 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers should accomplish 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers must achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
