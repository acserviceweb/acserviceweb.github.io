<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a reference in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight.
