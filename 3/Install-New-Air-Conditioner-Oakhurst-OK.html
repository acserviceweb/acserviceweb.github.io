<p>Working as an HVAC technician can be a very rewarding profession. This position supplies the opportunity for steady work given that there is space for lots of new professionals to go into the field.

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>We have been exceptionally pleased with Stability's devices (Trane dealership) and service (today Braxten finished yearly maintenance of our system). Trane heatpump has worked effectively and is so efficient that it substantially lowered our utility expenses - the system will pay for itself in less than 5 years. The few times we require them for emergencies they responded quickly and fixed the problem.<p>
