<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more tough to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to supply enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A common component required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
