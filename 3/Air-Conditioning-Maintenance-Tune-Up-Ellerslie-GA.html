<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce pollutants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>The early few years of your company are an amazing time, and it's tempting to let pure interest direct your path forward.

It's a framework to direct the launch or revamp of your business that you can build upon and restructure as the business evolves.<p>
