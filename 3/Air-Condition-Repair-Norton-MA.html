<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
