What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>

<p>The predominant health impact connected with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer.
