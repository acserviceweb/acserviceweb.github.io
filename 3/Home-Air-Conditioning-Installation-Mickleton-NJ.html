<p>Professional heater setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually stop working. HVAC specialists advise following this fundamental guideline when choosing whether it deserves buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost majority the cost of a brand-new system, it's finest to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than necessary.<p>
