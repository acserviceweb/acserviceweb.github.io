<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized system. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate since it merely takes more electrical power to run a larger unit. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
