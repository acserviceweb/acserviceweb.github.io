<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Installation in Havana Arkansas</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>When the temperature levels keep climbing up, geothermal air conditioning is a clever and cost-efficient  method to cool down your house or place of organisation. However when your AC system stops working effectively or starts to malfunction, you require a knowledgeable contractor to come in and get it repaired as quickly as possible. And that's where we can assist. At All The Time A/c & Heating, Inc. in Rye Brook, NY, we provide geothermal a/c repair services to commercial and residential clients alike.<p>
<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a tough job that the workers sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps people working. When a sales man comes to your house he exists to offer, that is the only method he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and should not "need" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I offer you the alternatives for your requirements and you decide if you need it.<p>
