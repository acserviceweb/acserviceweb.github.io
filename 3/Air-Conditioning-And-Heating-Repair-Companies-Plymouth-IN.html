<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew just what the issue was and repaired it really quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
