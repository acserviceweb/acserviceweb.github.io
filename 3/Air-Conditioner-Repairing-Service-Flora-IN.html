<p>We take a look at ideas before we supply recommendations to replace rather than repair a heating system. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy bills are higher every year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is normally greater than numerous heat pump options, they can still be highly efficient, depending upon the model you buy.
