<h3>HVAC Repair And You What You Want to Understand in Grayslake IL</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his examination, guaranteeing I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
