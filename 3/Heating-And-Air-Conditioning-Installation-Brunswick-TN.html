<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets ask for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, many of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>I have actually utilized around the clock for 5 plus years now. I have actually signed an annual maintenance agreement which covers 2 services every year. Ilan has been wonderful through all these years. Always keeps my system serviced and tuned. Have not had any problems.

<p>Fantastic Product! Delivery was sort of odd being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and takes time to use. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we solved concerns. I would advise this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
