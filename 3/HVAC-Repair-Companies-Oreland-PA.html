<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even small window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
