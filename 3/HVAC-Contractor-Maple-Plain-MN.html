<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating components installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, periodically linked to terminal systems like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heat.<p>

<p>Just like many house improvement jobs, the cost of a complete central heating system can differ widely based upon the size of the home. A lot of heaters will last between 15 and twenty years.
