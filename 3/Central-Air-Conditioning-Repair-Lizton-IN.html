<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Lizton IN</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most cost effective if your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated by radiators are prone to cold spots", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot next to the radiators. This typically leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up the house escape out of the window. Convected heat offers heat from the floor up throughout the room without any cold spots or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>
