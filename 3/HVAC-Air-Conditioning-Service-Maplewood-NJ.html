<p>Instantaneous discounts on high-efficiency heat pump technologies are readily available to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Exceptional Customer Service! Environment Pro is trustworthy and really cared about us and our situation. We got home one night to a cold home. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came over that very same night. Although he didn't have actually the needed replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he might search for and buy it the next morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely appreciative to have a heated house once again. What's most fantastic was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover someone to help us right prior to a vacation, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will gladly advise this company to my good friends.<p>
