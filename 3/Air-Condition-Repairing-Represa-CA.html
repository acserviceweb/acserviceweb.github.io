I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
