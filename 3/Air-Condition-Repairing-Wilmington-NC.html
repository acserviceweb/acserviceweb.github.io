Just like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). COP rates how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling result. Many ground source heatpump have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0.
