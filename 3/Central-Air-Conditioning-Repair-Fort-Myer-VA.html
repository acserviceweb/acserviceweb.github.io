<h3>Ventilation Double Flux in Fort Myer Virginia</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the go to. They advised replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the new part. I was really pleased they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>
<p>Airflow patterns in structure are determined by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Atmospheric pressure differences produced by these forces move airborne toxins from locations of greater pressure to areas of lower pressure through any available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move up until the within pressure is equal to the outside.<p>
<p>In more complex schemes, warm air is enabled to stream and rise out high building openings to the outside (stack effect ), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low structure openings. Natural ventilation plans can utilize very little energy, however care must be taken to make sure convenience. In damp or warm climates, keeping thermal convenience exclusively through natural ventilation may not be possible. Cooling systems are used, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers also use outdoors air to condition spaces, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outside air when appropriate.<p>

<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Fort Myer VA?</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
