<p>There is no simple response, but many utilize the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is most likely a better solution. If the present system has actually not incurred other major repairs, is in otherwise exceptional condition, and concerns that led to the breakdown can be determined and remedied, repairing the system can make a great deal of sense also.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For example, human beings exhale co2, which in little quantities is not poisonous, but may end up being hazardous if high concentrations are allowed to accumulate. Micro-organisms or germs might also be present within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do establish, they might spread throughout the entire work environment or building by means of the ventilation system.<p>
