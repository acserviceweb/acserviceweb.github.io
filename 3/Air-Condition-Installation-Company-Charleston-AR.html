<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer. Connection concerns along the line that provides power to your furnace can jeopardize the efficiency of the system. Loose, faulty or missing wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and interrupt service. Part of keeping your furnace includes examining the recommended connections as well as temperature and pressure determines. Take time to check these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are secure and tight.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Picture 6).<p>
