<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
