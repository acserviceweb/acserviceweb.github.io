<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps in Sunset SC</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in house construction is to lower air leakage through fractures and other openings in floorings, roofs, and walls. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air assists and waters down indoor pollutants tire them from the house.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a tube two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
