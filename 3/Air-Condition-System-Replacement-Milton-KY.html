<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money coming in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There need to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. With time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>Filters can get dirty quickly, particularly if you reside in an area that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, particles, germs, and tidy the air. They are accountable for maintaining the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned up and changed frequently, your HVAC system will ultimately stop performing as you expect it to. The heating & cooling will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will worsen. Checking and changing the air filters is one of the most essential aspects of HVAC maintenance.<p>
