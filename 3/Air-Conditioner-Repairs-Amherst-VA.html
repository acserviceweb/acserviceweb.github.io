<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from badly positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which might get in close-by ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis.
