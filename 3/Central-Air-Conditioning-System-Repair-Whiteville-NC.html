<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Whiteville NC?</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Lots of factors affect IAQ. These factors include bad ventilation (lack of outside air), issues controlling temperature level, low or high humidity, current remodeling, and other activities in or near a structure that can affect the fresh air entering into the structure. Often, particular impurities like dust from building or restoration, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (including small amounts of chemicals released as a gas with time) might cause poor IAQ.<p>
