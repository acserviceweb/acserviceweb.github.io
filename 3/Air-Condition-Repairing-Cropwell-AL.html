<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>A routine furnace tune up can go a long way towards minimizing a lot of the concerns caused by build-up of dirt and particles, and the assessments enable your contractor to monitor longer-term issues and take proactive steps to help avoid premature failure or troublesome breakdowns during the heating season. Annual furnace service might likewise be a requirement to keep your furnace warranty legitimate too. Many makers state on guarantee documents that installation and maintenance by a licensed HVAC service provider belong of the service warranty conditions. When you have a ten-year parts limited service warranty as is basic on Carrier ® heating systems, you'll wish to make certain you keep that coverage legitimate for the complete ten years.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
