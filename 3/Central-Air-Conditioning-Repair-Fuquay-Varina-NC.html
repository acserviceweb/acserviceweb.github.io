However, the computation of the total power is not simple, because it takes into consideration not only the small power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release contaminants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>

The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
