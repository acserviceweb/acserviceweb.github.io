<p>In addition, employee health symptoms such as colds, headaches, drowsiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing may be brought on as the outcome of temperature level extremes, inappropriate humidity levels, and insufficient or too much air flow.

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
