<p>When our furnace was passing away, we called two local companies for bids. While both were handy and informative, Ballard Natural Gas gave us a better offer, for extraordinary service. Instead of a simple sales job, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heating system and located ways we might have more even heat. He included these substantial but small modifications in his quote. Because of current warmer summers and for ecological reasons, we chose to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
