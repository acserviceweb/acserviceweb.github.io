<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price excellent but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a referral in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>

I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
