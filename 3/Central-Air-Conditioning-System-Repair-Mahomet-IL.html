<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
