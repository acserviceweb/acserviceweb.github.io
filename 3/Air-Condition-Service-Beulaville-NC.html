<p>My oldest son always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it really didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly consider anything else except replacing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
