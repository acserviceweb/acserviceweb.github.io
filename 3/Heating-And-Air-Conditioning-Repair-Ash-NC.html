<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely practical in collecting information on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to temporarily deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and provided clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.
