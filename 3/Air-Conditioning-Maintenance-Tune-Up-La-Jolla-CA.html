<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a tube twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year turned off the electrical energy open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
