<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you need to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system.

If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
