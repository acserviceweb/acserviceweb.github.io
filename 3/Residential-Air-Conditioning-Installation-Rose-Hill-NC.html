It's a scientific method of identifying just how much energy the system moves versus how much it utilizes. Most geothermal heat pump systems have COPs of 3.0 to 5.0. This means for every unit of energy used to power the system, 3 to 5 units are supplied as heat.<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>There is an essential balance in making your decision though as systems with higher AFUE scores often include greater cost. So, make sure to decide based on how typically you will utilize your heating system, the load that will be placed on it and the frequency with which you intend on having it serviced each year. For a lot of temperate climates with low heating loads in the winter, having a very high ranked heating unit is not constantly essential.<p>

Your contractor selects each part of the system individually so that whatever operates at leading effectiveness to provide the comfort you need. All the system elements are matched-the furnace, the condensing system, fans and blowers, air conditioning coil, the duct work-to produce a heating and cooling system that will work best for you.<p>
