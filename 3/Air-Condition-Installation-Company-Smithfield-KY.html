<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
