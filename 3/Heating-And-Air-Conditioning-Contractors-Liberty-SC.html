<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not provide them.  Secondly like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed skills to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to properly service and the unit has actually been running issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
