<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential buildings has become a crucial problem to house owners and health experts. Indoor air pollution studies have determined a number of impurities that can be present in indoor air. These include combustion items, unstable organic compounds (including formaldehyde), tobacco smoke, bioaerosols, and pesticides. Proper ventilation and removal of the sources of these contaminants are essential in keeping great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The ability of organic chemicals to trigger health effects varies significantly, from those that are highly toxic, to those with no known health effect. As with other contaminants, the extent and nature of the health effect will depend upon many elements consisting of level of exposure and length of time exposed. Eye and breathing tract inflammation, headaches, dizziness, visual conditions, and memory problems are among the instant symptoms that some individuals have experienced not long after direct exposure to some organics. At present, very little is understood about what health results happen from the levels of organics usually found in homes. Many natural substances are understood to cause cancer in animals; some are suspected of causing, or are known to trigger, cancer in people.<p>

<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company.
