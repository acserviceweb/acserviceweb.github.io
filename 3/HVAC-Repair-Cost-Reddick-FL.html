<h3>Turning to the Ideal Company for the Right Furnace Repair in Reddick FL</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor unit instead of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Both should be kept clean because an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
