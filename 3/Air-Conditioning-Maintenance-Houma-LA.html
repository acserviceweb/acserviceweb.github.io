<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and place of contaminant direct exposure. An example of time control is arranging flooring stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday. This permits items to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the staff are at home over the weekend. Area control includes moving the toxin source away from occupants or even transferring prone occupants.<p>
<p>There are some more serious dangers for HVAC workers that could be possibly fatal. They can be exposed to Carbon monoxide gas which can be toxic.

<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the ac system works but your house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
