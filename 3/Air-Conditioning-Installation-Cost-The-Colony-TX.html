Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again.

If the exhaust outlets are obstructed, they can result in a hazardous build-up and compromise your safety. The technician will assess all of these elements of your system and examine the chimney flue and vent stack also. They will look for indications of rust, leakages, and back draft and repair the issue throughout their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>Utilize specialists and treat them well: Inspired, well-compensated experts carry out better work than short-term subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success.
