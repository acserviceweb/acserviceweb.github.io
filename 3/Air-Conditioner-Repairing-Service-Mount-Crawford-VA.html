<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power needs to not go beyond the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems greater than the outside capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, given that the total capability of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outside unit. Basically, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that a few of the rooms might not have a really comfy temperature level. However, the calculation of the overall power is not basic, because it takes into account not only the nominal power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
