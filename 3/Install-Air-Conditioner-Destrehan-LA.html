<h3>Pool Heat Pump in Destrehan Louisiana</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
