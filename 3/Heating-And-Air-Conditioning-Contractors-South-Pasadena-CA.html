<p>The life expectancy of a central air conditioning system is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's a/c are more energy effective than models made 5 years back, so it makes financial sense to change or upgrade your unit if it's 5 years of ages or older.

<p>Even if you do not feel dirty, pollen hold on to your hair and clothes where it can quickly aggravate your nose and eyes, and add to indoor air pollution. Do not have time for a fast rinse? A minimum of wash your hands to get rid of lingering pollen, particularly prior to reaching food or your face, recommends the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. Attempt these tricks to pollen-proof your life, particularly throughout allergy season.<p>
<p>Great Item! Shipment was sort of strange being that package was opened and items could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we fixed problems. I would suggest this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
<p>Many disconnect blocks contain two cartridge fuses. Examine them before you continue with repairs (Image 3). A blown fuse suggests a stopping working part inside the condensing system. So don't simply replace it and believe you've solved the issue. Rather, replace the parts we reveal here. Then set up new fuses and fire up the system. If it blows once again, call a pro-- you have actually got more serious issues.<p>
