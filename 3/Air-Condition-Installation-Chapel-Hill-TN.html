<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have actually been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. Try a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
