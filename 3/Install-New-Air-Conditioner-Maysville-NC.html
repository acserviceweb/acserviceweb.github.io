<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
