<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have actually been around considering that the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floors and tied them into a hot water supply.

The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. However, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>
