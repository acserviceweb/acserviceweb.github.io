The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>I generally don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>

And for additional support, specifically for bigger ac system, think about acquiring a steel assistance bracket and mount it to the outdoors home wall, straight below the windowsill.<p>
