<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner boost. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
