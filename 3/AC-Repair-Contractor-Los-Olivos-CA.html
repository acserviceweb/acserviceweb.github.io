The present pattern in home building and construction is to lower air leakage through fractures and other openings in walls, floorings, and roofs. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air assists and waters down indoor pollutants exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter.

If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
