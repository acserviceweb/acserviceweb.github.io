<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heaters are still extensively used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>If you think a mold issue-- either since of visible growth or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not eliminate the mold.
