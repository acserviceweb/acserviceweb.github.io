<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
