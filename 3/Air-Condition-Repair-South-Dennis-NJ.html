<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, since some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>

<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a regular oil change in your cars and truck.

Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star recommends changing your filter when every three months. During high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
