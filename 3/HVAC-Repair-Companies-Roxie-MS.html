<p>The federal government advises that houses be weatherized in order to decrease the quantity of energy needed for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, steps must likewise be required to decrease pollution from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for recommended actions.) In addition, homeowners must be alert to the development of indications of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization procedures ought to not be carried out up until these problems have actually been fixed.<p>
