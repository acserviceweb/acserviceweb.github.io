<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at varying temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the exact same period.

<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company utilized 98% of the existing material bought with your home. This company introduced a service agreement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the inspection on an extremely cold day they killed the furnace claiming health threat reason and contractor laws for their choice.
