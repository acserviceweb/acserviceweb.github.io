The primary route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may enter nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis.
