<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside system as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
