<h3>Heat Pump Air Conditioner in Littleton Colorado</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00.

That said, property buyers looking to go green," who focus on energy cost savings, or who definitely want an in-floor heating unit will want to pay a premium for a home that features one.<p>
