<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
