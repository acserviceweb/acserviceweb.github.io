The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house.

Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other factors that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
