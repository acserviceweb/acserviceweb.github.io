Temperature level levels need to range from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts caused by excessive air circulation ought to be avoided.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema.

In kitchen areas and bathrooms, mold and mildew can become a nuisance where wetness levels are normally higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
