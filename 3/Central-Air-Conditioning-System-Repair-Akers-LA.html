<p>Improve your services, earn more services profits, and supply an amazing customer experience. To ensure the unit you select is the ideal size for your house, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load estimation estimate to determine the exact type of heat and a/c system that's ideal for your home-we do not simply replace it with the very same size unit you presently have. These calculations consider things such as the size of your house, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is vital so the system isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>
