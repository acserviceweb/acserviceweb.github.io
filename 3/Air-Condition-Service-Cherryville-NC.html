<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can manage, many Seattleites must find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in big box shops like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle may be the last city in the country to deal with the reality of a terrible, harsh summer.<p>
