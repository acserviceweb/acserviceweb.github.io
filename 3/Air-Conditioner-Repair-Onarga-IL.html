<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to minimize the quantity of energy required for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions ought to likewise be required to decrease pollution from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.)

<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the exact same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately cure and harden-- typically two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
