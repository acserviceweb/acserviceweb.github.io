<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release pollutants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outside air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heater, consider potential results of indoor air contamination. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, specifically instructions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating system correctly changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is usually an indicator of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heater remains in use, open a door from the space where the heater is located to the remainder of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
