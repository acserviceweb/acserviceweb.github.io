<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the proper temperature. Heating systems that kick on often may be due to a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas gets in houses through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains pipes, and sumps. When radon becomes caught in concentrations and buildings develop indoors, direct exposure to radon ends up being a concern.<p>

<p>The majority of HVAC systems now have programmable thermostats that allow homeowner to manage the temperature and set it on a schedule.
