<p>Reality: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely unusual now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>Whatever heater you install, it's essential that it's sized correctly for your home. Too large and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should.
