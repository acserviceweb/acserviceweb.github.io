It secures the environment from harmful digging, fracking, or toxins since the energy utilized to heat your home is extracted directly from the ground. Geothermal systems utilize compressor and evaporator systems similar to those used in refrigerators. While geothermal systems do utilize some electrical power, they launch far fewer greenhouse gases or other pollutants than heater that need gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
