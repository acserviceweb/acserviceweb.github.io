<p>Utilizing a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly lowers direct exposure to pollutants during cooking. Inappropriate modification, often indicated by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, causes increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame suggestion is blue. If you purchase a new gas stove or variety, consider buying one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot burner that burns continuously. Never use a gas stove to heat your house.
