<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside system as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
