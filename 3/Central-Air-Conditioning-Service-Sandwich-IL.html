<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as merely radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements set up in the subfloor of each space in the home, occasionally connected to terminal systems like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
