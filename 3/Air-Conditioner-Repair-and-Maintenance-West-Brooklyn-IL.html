<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
