The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects contaminants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage efficiency rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air assists and dilutes indoor contaminants exhaust them from the home.<p>
