They consist of hold-ups in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Babies, kids, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead exposure than grownups given that lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the destructive results of lead.

<h3>Fixing Your Boiler in Forest VA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his evaluation, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<h3>AC Compressor in Forest VA</h3>
<p>Today's house radiant heat systems take full advantage of infrared radiation. By far, the most common source of a radiator in a house is the flooring mass.

Send for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to learn more about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for additional information.<p>
