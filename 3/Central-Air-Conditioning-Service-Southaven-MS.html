<p>Old lead-based paint is the most considerable source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is poorly eliminated from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in houses can also result from lead dust from outdoor sources, including polluted soil tracked inside, and usage of lead in specific indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>Specific types of HVAC units are a bit more expensive than wall units, ceiling or cassette units are neatly concealed inside the ceiling in the classroom and are therefore more discreet and visually pleasing to take a look at. They supply effective airflow and are considerably more effective than basic wall systems and can, therefore, reduce the number of units required and this can decrease installation and or replacement costs where several HVAC units are required. Ducted commercial-grade a/c systems are BETTER for the academic environment. They are normally the most costly alternative; however, they are also the most aesthetically pleasing as the duct-work and internal systems concealed with minimal presence.<p>

The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in.
