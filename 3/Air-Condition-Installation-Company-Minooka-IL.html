For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy.
