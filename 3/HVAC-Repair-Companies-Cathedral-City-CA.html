<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. Due to the fact that approximately 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless unit has a built-in performance advantage. Ductless heat pumps are great for additions since they do not require any new ductwork to be installed. Since an unit is set up in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>

This makes geothermal heating a offered and trusted  source of energy.<p>
