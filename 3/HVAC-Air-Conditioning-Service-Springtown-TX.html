<h3>Boiler Heating System in Springtown TX</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
