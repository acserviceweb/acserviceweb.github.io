The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>Considering that the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they make more effective. This was originally driven by rising energy costs, and has more recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental concerns. In addition, improvements to the HVAC system effectiveness can also assist increase resident health and efficiency. 21 In the United States, the EPA has imposed tighter restrictions throughout the years. There are several techniques for making HVAC systems more effective.<p>
<p>Unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals produced as gases from processes or products; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a brand-new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the industry's growth does not always translate to the experience of running an HVAC company. The heating, air and ventilation conditioning company tends to run hot and cold. Need warms up during the summer and winter season when clients require their HVAC systems fixed for relief against the cold and heat; service calls drop off when milder weather arrives.<p>
