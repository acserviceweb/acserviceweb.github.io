<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace professionals often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Replacing Your Boiler in Lacey WA</h3>
