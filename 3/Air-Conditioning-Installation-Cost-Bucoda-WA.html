<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. With time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
