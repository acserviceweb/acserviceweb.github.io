<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise given that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power needs to not exceed the capacity of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems greater than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, since the overall capability of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outside unit. Basically, the outside system will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the spaces might not have an extremely comfy temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not easy, since it takes into account not only the nominal power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor unit as near to your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
