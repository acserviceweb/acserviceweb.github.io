<h3>Electric Heat Pump in Rio Grande New Jersey</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>Another alternative to oil furnaces are gas heating systems While oil is generally utilized in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have an option between the 2 types.
