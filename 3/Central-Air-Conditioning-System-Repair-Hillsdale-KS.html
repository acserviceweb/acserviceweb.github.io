<h3>Electric Heating System in Hillsdale KS</h3>
<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two need to not be puzzled.
