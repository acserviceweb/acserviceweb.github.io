<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>All homes need reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been stressed out from usage. Another possible factor might be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the appropriate temperature level. Heating systems that kick on regularly may be due to a filthy filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>

Increase the length and width of each space in your house that you heat and build up all the spaces together to get your total square video footage.<p>
<p>Though it may be tough to believe, the air inside your house can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are notorious for decreasing the air quality in your house, however there are numerous other pollutants that can not only unclean up the air, but cause other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and building products add to poor air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (unpredictable organic compounds) from paint and even from some type of carpeting and upholstery materials can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>

<p>The primary health effect associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
