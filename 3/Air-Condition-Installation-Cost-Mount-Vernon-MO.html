Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
