<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As an initial step, in April RMI affirmed before the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor standards based on the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor devices through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is a chance to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Since the 1980s, producers of HVAC devices have been making an effort to make the systems they produce more effective. This was initially driven by rising energy expenses, and has actually more just recently been driven by increased awareness of ecological concerns. In addition, improvements to the HVAC system efficiency can also help increase resident health and performance. 21 In the US, the EPA has actually imposed tighter limitations for many years. There are several techniques for making HVAC systems more efficient.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your house that ideal temperature level all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those typical air toxins. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job.

So, make certain to alter your AC filters frequently, or get an a/c service plan which usually consists of a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
