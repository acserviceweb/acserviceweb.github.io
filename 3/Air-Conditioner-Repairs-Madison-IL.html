<p>The split system is the most common. Most people are used to seeing this type in the yards of houses. With split system units, the majority of the components are housed in a metal box outside of the home. However, there are some internal elements also. Split systems are ideal for cooling numerous spaces at the same time, but are not really energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud equipment in the house.

For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering early deterioration, resulting in holes and cracks. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the component.  a really helpful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
