<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heating systems, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
