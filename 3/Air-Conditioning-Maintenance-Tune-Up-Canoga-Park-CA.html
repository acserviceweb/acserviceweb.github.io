<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Service in Canoga Park</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, instead of industrial or outside settings. In tasks where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It might also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to specific spaces.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate great but Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
