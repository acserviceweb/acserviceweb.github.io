<p>Sean was extremely valuable. He is a very pleasant individual to work with. No pressure applied to purchase additional stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no issues aside from the blower motor.
