<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, rather than outside or industrial settings. In jobs where union subscription is not a problem, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It might likewise include the installation of registers where the ductwork links to private areas.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Packaged a/c often include electric heating coils or a gas furnace. This combination of ac system and central heating unit eliminates the requirement for a different furnace inside your home.<p>
<p>Chandler's group arrived on time and carried out a 71 item maintenance assessment checklist. This included at no additional cost, getting rid of guards and debris, examining the electronics and cleaning agent cleaning and reassembling the outdoor system. The inside system received the very same precise observation and care. Very courteous and always compulsively putting on shoe covers when coming within.
