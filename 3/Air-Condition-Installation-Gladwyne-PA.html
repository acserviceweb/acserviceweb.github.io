<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
