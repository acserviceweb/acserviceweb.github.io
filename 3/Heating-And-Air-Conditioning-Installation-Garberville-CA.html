<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable greater airflow from the outside, air quality monitoring platforms and sensors, and new air filtration innovations are ending up being more common as offered services in residential and commercial HVAC product bundles. Adoption of these technologies, nevertheless, has actually not been extensive, as customers stay mainly unconcerned to the results of air quality on health and productivity.<p>
