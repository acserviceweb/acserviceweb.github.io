<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to use auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract..
