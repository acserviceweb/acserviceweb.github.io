<h3>Boiler Heating System in Santa Paula CA</h3>
<p>In homes, the most substantial sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pressed wood products made using adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood products made for indoor usage consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furniture); wood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard consists of a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood item and is usually acknowledged as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood item.<p>
<p>Many well and city water does not typically contain lead. Water usually picks up lead inside the home from household plumbing that is made with lead materials. If there is lead in drinking water is to have it tested, the only method to know. Contact the local health department or the water provider to find out how to get the water tested. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to find out more about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more information.<p>
