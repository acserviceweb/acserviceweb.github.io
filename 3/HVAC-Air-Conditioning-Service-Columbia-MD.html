<h3>Things to Consider When Buying a Heat Pump in Columbia MD</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even little window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or washed as conditions require. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature level, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
