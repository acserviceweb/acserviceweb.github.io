<p>How environment change impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern-day air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner boost. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

A split-system is the most affordable central air conditioner to install if your house already has a furnace however no air conditioner.<p>
