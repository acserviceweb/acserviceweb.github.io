What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>

Even when it was news my client probably wouldn't want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the sincerity. Integrity isn't just their name, it's a business model they take seriously. You people are officially on speed dial. Talk with you soon.<p>
