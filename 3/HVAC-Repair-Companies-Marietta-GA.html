While contaminants commonly found in indoor air can cause many damaging impacts, there is considerable unpredictability about what concentrations or durations of exposure are required to produce particular illness.

When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
