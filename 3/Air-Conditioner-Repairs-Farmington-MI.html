<h3>Furnace Cost in Farmington Michigan</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>A geothermal heater does not produce its power by burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas, or coal. Instead, it soaks up heat from within the earth.

This makes a geothermal heating unit an appealing solution to cut your carbon footprint, supplying a positive effect on the environment.<p>
