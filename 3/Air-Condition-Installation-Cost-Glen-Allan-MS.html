<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
