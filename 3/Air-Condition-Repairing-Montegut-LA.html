The fluid circulates around this loop, sending the taken in heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>

Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>
