<p>Information provided in this safety guide is based upon existing clinical and technical understanding of the problems provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits established by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. Buildings continuously evolve as a result of the changes in the environment around them along with the occupants, products, and activities within them. The different surfaces and the air inside a structure are constantly communicating, and this interaction results in changes in each. For example, we might see a window as altering slightly gradually as it becomes unclean, then is cleaned up, builds up dirt once again, is cleaned again, and so on through its life. In truth, the dirt" we see might be evolving as a result of the interactions among the wetness, chemicals, and biological materials discovered there.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned routinely, they can become clogged with particles that can limit airflow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Dirty filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down entirely. By comparison, inspecting and replacing a furnace filter can typically be carried out in simply a couple of minutes, often with no tools required. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
