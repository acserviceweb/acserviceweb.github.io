<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not use auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in every month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement..
