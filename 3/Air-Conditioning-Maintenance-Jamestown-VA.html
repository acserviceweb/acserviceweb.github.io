<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to save energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the greater temperatures sometimes used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to supply thermal comfort inside your home. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors creates the need for cautious attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities trigger mold development and wetness indoors is connected with a higher frequency of occupant respiratory problems.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
