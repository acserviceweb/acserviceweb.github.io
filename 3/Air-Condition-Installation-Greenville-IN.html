<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
