<h3>Common Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Greenville TX</h3>

That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off prior to it has an opportunity to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>
