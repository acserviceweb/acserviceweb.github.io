<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
