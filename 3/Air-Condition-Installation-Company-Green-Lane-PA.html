<h3>The Most Frequent Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transmitting the taken in heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
<p>Since an air conditioner moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept tidy. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
