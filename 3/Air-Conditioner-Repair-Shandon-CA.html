<h3>Energy Efficient Heaters in Shandon CA</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung out fixing the issue, all the while describing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
