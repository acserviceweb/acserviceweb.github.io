<p>Today's home convected heat systems take full advantage of infrared radiation. By far, the most typical source of a radiator in a house is the flooring mass. Radiators can be locally located in one area like a restroom floor or be set up across the entire sub-surface of the home's floors. Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating units-- although ceiling radiators are generally used in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>
<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated by radiators are prone to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators. This generally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up the house escape out of the window. Radiant heat provides heat from the floor up throughout the space without any cold areas or stuffiness in the location being heated up.<p>
