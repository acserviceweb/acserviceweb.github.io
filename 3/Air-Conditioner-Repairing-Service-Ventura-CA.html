<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Some biological pollutants trigger allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma. Contagious diseases, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Mildews and molds launch disease-causing contaminants. Symptoms of illness caused by biological toxins consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, lethargy, fever, and digestion problems.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas. Due to the fact that it is difficult to see, smell or taste, CO can eliminate you before you are aware it remains in your home. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO causes moderate impacts that are frequently mistaken for the flu. These signs include headaches, dizziness, disorientation, fatigue and queasiness. The results of CO direct exposure can vary considerably from person to person depending upon age, general health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
