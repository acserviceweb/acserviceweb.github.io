<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
