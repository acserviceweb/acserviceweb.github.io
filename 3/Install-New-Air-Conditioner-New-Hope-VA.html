<p>Convected heat systems are significantly popular, especially in the past quarter-century as innovation has actually advanced, and the systems have shown themselves in reliability and economy. Unlike convection heating, convected heat systems have no air and no ductwork blood circulation. Radiant systems depend upon heat transfer by the infrared clinical concept used by the sun called view." These invisible electro-magnetic infrared waves radiate out from a warmed thermal mass. In a contained system like a house, the warmer items naturally heat the cooler ones up until a balance is achieved.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
