Your heating and cooling contractor must assess and, if needed, update the structure envelope. For example, he may seal gaps and fractures in the outer walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating expenses. Insulation may be a more efficient option to your cooling problems than replacing your devices.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your home still heats up to the right temperature. The temperature level of the air produced by the heatpump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel extremely hot. If your house is not heating up, only be concerned. Nevertheless, if your system does not seem working properly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up.

If we do decide to use car debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
