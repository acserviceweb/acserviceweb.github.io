<h3>Recognizing the Significance of HVAC Systems at Boston KY</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely pleased that someone as experienced as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c unit before you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to check AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had known him then.<p>
<p>Check these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the issue.<p>
