<p>After residing in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the air conditioning. I went ahead and purchased this Carrier and I must state it does the job rather well. It takes really little time to warm up or cool off your house which is among the things we didnâ $ t obtain from the one we had in the past. The system hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature, and then change it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
