Some sources, such as developing materials, furnishings and products like air fresheners, can release toxins more or less continually. Other sources, associated to activities like smoking, cleaning, remodeling or doing hobblies release toxins intermittently. Malfunctioning or unvented appliances or poorly used products can launch greater and in some cases harmful levels of contaminants inside your home.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas gets in houses through dirt floors, cracks in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains pipes, and sumps. When radon ends up being trapped in buildings and concentrations build up indoors, direct exposure to radon ends up being a concern.<p>

<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
