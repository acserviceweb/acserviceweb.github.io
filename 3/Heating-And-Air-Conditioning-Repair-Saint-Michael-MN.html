<p>A specialized air conditioning system that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard ac system because both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the same air path. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, given that all elements of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is actually heated up, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
