<p>Though it may be hard to think, the air inside your house can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are infamous for lowering the air quality in your home, but there are many other toxins that can not only filthy up the air, but lead to other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and structure products contribute to bad air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (unpredictable natural substances) from paint and even from some kinds of carpeting and upholstery products can cause issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more difficult to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products consist of vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. These products present a danger just when they are dealt with in such a way that produces dust containing asbestos fibers which can be breathed in. When asbestos-containing products are damaged or disrupted by repair, remodeling, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can become airborne if appropriate controls are not in place. This can lead to the capacity for considerable health problems.<p>
