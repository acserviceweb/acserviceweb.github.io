<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for consultation and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. However, many of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
