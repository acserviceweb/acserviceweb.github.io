<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area. All objects in the hot zone reach stability in temperature after the convected heat system has actually been running for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
