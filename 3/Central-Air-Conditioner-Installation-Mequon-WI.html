<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
