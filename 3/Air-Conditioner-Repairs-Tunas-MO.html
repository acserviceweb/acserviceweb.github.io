<p>As many of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all significant devices manufacturer's to ensure your factory guarantees stay in location. In addition, the concrete results of a PM is often hard to measure, as one reaction mentioned the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. The majority of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system don't simply break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the outcome of repeated use of a component that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, leading to holes and cracks. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the element.  a very advantageous outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
