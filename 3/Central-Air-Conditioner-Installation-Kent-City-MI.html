<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heaters are still extensively used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, along with all other kinds of heat pumps, have actually effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of performance, or POLICE. It's a clinical method of determining just how much energy the system moves versus just how much it uses. Most geothermal heat pump systems have Polices of 3.0 to 5.0. This suggests for each unit of energy used to power the system, 3 to five units are supplied as heat.<p>
