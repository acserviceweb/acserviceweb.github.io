<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. Because approximately 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated performance benefit. Because they do not require any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Due to the fact that an unit is installed in each space or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>

So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
