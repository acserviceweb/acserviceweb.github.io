When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
