<p>The federal government suggests that houses be weatherized in order to minimize the amount of energy needed for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions need to also be required to reduce contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for suggested actions.) In addition, citizens ought to be alert to the introduction of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization procedures should not be undertaken till these problems have actually been fixed.<p>
<p>They were great! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They met my requirements totally by offering a professional quote with options, without pressing additional products. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The also promptly followed up with the needed assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
