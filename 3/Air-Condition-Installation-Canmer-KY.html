I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he encouraged me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again, he assisted me problem shoot the concern. He is sincere, trusted, and affordable on rate. It's difficult to find a truthful AC guy and I'm delighted I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
