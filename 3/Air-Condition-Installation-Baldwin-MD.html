<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
