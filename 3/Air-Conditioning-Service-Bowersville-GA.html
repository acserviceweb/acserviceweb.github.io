<h3>Is Your Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Bowersville GA?</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even small window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew just what the problem was and fixed it very rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

Leaking refrigerant can harm your car's evaporator and compressor. Getting a car a/c unit service at the very first indication of problem will save you both money and time.

<p>After the system has been looked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside need to be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
