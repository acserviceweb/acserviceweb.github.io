<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

(Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water usage.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heating system appears less like a luxury product and more like a need. (Besides, heated up floorings were great enough for the Roman Empire) However before you devote to what can be a major remodeling task, it's best to ask yourself whether a radiant flooring heating unit is an appropriate service for your specific home heating needs.<p>
