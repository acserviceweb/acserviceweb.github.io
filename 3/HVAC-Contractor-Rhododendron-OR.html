<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Rhododendron OR</h3>

These systems can attain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just attain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE rates how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to create the heating or cooling impact. The majority of ground source heat pumps have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every unit of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the form of heat.<p>
