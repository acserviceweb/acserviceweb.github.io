<h3>Tips to Help You Hire Brownstown IN Professionals for Air Conditioning Repair</h3>

<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
