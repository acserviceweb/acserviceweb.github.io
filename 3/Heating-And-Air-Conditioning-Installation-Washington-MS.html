<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Washington MS?</h3>
<p>Elements that can add to the development of biological impurities are wet or damp structure products (carpets, ceilings, walls) and badly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioning system. "Humidifier fever" is a common disease triggered by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Different fungis and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these pollutants can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the building residents. Other possible sources of biological impurities are pets and family plants.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
