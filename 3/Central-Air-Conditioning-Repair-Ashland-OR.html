<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. When they laid a network of pipes under their marble floorings and connected them into a hot water supply, radiant heat systems have actually been around because the days of the Romans.

<p>Reality: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth.
