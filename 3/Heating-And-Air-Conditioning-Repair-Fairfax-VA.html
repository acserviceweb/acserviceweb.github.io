<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roofing, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, but it is likewise an alternative for property owners to think about. Oftentimes, these units contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged units are great for those looking to save cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, since the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are typically just offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best choice for property owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
