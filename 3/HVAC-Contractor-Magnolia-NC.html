<p>Usually the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of pollution or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to reduce the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more affordable technique to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later on in this section.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
