<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat.

A few of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>
