<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very handy in gathering details on the phone and offering clear directions about how to momentarily manage the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
