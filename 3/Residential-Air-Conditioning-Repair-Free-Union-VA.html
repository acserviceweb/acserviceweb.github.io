<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
