<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The minimized airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up.
