<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Spring Valley NY</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the task based only on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few sensible ones got. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex properly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install team was respectful of my house and set up the devices in the expected amount of time. post install inspection results look excellent for braising and plumbing quality.

Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
