Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the brand-new control panel need to be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t properly detected, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable when set up. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a professional to diagnose.<p>
