<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning a company was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to construct business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners need to pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the very same in all other locations.<p>
