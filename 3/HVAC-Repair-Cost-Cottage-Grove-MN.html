<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Cottage Grove MN</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
