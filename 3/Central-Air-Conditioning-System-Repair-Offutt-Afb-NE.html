<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the standard water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off completely.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
