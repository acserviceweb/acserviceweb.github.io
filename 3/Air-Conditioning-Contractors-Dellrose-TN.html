<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
