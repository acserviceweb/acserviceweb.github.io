The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future.

<p>Measurement treatments are being established and demonstrated to assess building ventilation and indoor contaminant concentrations. These procedures range from sophisticated tracer gas techniques utilized mainly in building research study efforts to less involved procedures that can be utilized by constructing operators. NIST researchers are continually establishing new test procedures, and after that showing them in the field to assess their feasibility and reliability. The efforts in which these treatments are shown in the field has led to the advancement of an essential database of structure ventilation and indoor air quality performance.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide should be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements used for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
