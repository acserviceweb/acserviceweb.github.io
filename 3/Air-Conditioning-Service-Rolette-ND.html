But a number of the important things individuals do-- or don't do-- can contribute to the stew of airborne contaminants in their houses and aggravate asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>For example, impurities may collect within the air diffusers and grills, introducing contaminants into the environment. Or if the outdoor air consumption is located near a source of wetness or other outdoor contaminant, it might work as a pathway to carry the pollutants inside.

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house residents. Unlike other types of air conditioning system, evaporative coolers depend on the outside air to be transported through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the within a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be enabled to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to understand and maintain.<p>
