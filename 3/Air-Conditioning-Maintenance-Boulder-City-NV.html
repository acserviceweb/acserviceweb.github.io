<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
