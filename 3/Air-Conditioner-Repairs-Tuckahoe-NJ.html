<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner boost. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>A SEER rating represents Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER rating of a system is the cooling output at varying temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the same duration. Essentially, SEER offers more data based on how the EER performs in different temps. The greater the system's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER ranking can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all home appliances.<p>
