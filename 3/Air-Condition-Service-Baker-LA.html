<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>We take a look at clues before we supply advice to change instead of repair a heating unit. Among the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are greater year after year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It may be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be squandering money by not changing the older unit.<p>
