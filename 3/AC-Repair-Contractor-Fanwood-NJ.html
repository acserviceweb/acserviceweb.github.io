<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, class or lab environments, instead of commercial or outdoor settings. In tasks where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It might also include the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to private areas.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking means Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER ranking of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperatures during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the exact same duration. Basically, SEER provides more information based on how the EER carries out in various temps. The greater the system's SEER ranking, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all appliances.<p>
