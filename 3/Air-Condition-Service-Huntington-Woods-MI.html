<p>Cooling can also be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
