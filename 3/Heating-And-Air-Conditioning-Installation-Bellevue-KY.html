<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the floor level.

All things in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the convected heat system has been running for a while, consisting of people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins and that sudden shot of coolness when it turns off.<p>
