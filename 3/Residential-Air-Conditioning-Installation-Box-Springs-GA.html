<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside system as near to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
