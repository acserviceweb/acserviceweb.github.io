<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
