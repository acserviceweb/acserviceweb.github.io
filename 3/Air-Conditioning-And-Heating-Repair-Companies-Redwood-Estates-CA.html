When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue.
