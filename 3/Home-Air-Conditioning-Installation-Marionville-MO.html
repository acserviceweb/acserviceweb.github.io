(If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
