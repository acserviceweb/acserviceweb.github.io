<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everybody can afford, numerous Seattleites should find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in big box shops like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC units are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to face the truth of a cruel, harsh summer season.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by people and animals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
