<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices usually lasts years, given that it is protected inside. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical guidelines eliminate the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more tough to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity ought to be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
