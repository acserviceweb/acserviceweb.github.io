<p>If you think a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
