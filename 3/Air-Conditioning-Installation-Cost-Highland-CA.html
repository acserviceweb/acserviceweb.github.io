<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on various house effectiveness upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the largest savings.
