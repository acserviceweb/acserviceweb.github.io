Proceed to another contractor if the one you're considering wants to determine the best system for your home entirely on experience. Though highly affected by where you live, numerous factors impact the size unit needed, including the quantity of wall and attic insulation you have; the types and placement of doors and windows; and the orientation of your house to the sun.

This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
