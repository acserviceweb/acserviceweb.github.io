<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
