<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the exact same. As soon as the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately solidify and cure-- typically two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
<p>By piping coolant straight into the smaller sized wall-mounted units, ductless splits enable you to avoid the requirement for a complete duct system like many other cooling systems need. You will also enjoy a much more flexible system in regards to installation and cost.
