<p>Indoor contaminants. These consist of chemicals utilized in the building and construction or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops need to be utilized with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices need to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to remove products of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also produce particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>
<p>Air pollutants can range from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your pets to harmful gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a common air pollutant resulting from natural gas that escapes into your home without being burnt. Older houses might contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In cooking areas and bathrooms, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where wetness levels are usually greater than in the rest of your home.<p>

Senseware, an intelligent structure startup known for air quality monitoring, launched a solution package in collaboration with other vendors to help customers safely reopen their companies. Molekule, a residential air cleanser startup, introduced a new product, now for health care use, and got a FDA 510( k) Class II Medical Gadget Clearance.<p>
