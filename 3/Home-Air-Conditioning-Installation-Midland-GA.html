<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn On Your Air Conditioner at Midland GA</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very happy that someone as skilled as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to test the air conditioning system prior to you purchase. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to evaluate AC systems even in winter. We wish we had known him then.<p>
