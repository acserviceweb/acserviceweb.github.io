<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer vehicle debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
