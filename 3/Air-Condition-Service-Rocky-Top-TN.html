<p>In a location where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good main heating systems. You'll want to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperatures reach freezing. If temperature levels drop and reach below freezing, your heating technician can set up controls which automatically shut down the heat pump. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, effectively heating the house in these conditions.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works however your house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
