<p>Usually, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC system is wintry. Likewise, if the air conditioning unit smells bad, there could be germs buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil soaks up the heat away from your house.
