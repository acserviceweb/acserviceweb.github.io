<p>Great Product! Shipment was sort of odd being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The product was very lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we dealt with problems. I would suggest this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>

Professionals recommend utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, but higher MERV levels trap smaller particles and typically are more appropriate for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
