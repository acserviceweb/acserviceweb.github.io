<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

In the process, heat is soaked up from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
