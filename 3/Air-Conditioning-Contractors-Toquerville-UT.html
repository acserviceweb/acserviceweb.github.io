<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the objective of owning a service was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it required to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't completion goal.
