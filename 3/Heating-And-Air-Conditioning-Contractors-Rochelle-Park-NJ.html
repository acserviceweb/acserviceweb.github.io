<h3>Hints to Help You Repair Your Furnace in Rochelle Park NJ</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system. We chose getting something more pricey than a standard water heater as gas is among our greatest energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
