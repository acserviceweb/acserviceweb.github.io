<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and place of toxin exposure. An example of time control is scheduling floor stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday.

Place control includes moving the pollutant source far from occupants or perhaps moving vulnerable residents.<p>
<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (style levels), instead of the greater temperatures sometimes utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for the majority of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to supply thermal convenience inside your home.

This lessens the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to offer heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c unit into a heat pump While room cooling provides optimum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is typically more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
