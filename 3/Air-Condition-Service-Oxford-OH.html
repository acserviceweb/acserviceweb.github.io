<p>The EPA and CMHC scientists utilized various methodologies. The CMHC study contacted several duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they were part of a study, and the scientists did not control for time spent or approaches used. The EPA study prescribed and managed techniques used on a smaller sized variety of homes.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
