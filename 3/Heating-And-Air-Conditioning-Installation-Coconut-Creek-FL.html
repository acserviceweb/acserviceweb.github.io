<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
