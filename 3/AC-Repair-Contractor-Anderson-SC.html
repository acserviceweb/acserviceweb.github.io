<p>Due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house via ducts, and cool air is gathered via cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for effectiveness. Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a relatively simple procedure. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather pricey.<p>
