<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a reference in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>

For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually consider anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s fantastic on energy saving too.<p>
