<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol result, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from badly put or kept evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may get in nearby ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and retirement home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outside fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
