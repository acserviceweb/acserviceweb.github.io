<p>As a number of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment maker's to ensure your factory warranties stay in location. Furthermore, the tangible results of a PM is frequently tough to quantify, as one response stated the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented.

For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering early degeneration, causing holes and fractures. If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the part.  a really beneficial result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
