<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost great but Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
