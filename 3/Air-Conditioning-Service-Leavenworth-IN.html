<p>Since it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your house via ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for effectiveness. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%.

<p>The heat pump gained appeal in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heat pumps can extract heat from various sources, such as ecological air, exhaust air from a structure, or from the ground. Heatpump transfer heat from outside the structure into the air within. Initially, heatpump HVAC systems were only utilized in moderate climates, however with improvements in low temperature level operation and decreased loads due to more efficient houses, they are increasing in appeal in cooler climates.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning system works but your house does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic.
