<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix utilized in vehicles in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12.

<p>If the AC does not switch off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur over time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts.
