<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
