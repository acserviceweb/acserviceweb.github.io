<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ problem. Your employer must examine measurements of humidity, air and temperature level circulation. In addition, evaluation and screening of the ventilation, heating and air conditioning systems (to ensure it is working according to requirements for developing usage and tenancy) ought to be performed. A structure walk-through to look for odors and search for water damage, leakages, dirt or pest droppings may be practical. Leakages need to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c units, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can end up being contaminated with fungis or germs and need to be removed, also. In some scenarios, particular screening for radon or for asbestos might be required as part of structure tenancy. For instance, in schools asbestos needs to be inspected every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Threat Emergency Reaction Act-AHERA).<p>
