<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heaters are still extensively used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>A SEER score stands for Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER score of an unit is the cooling output at varying temperatures during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the very same duration. Essentially, SEER supplies more data based upon how the EER carries out in various temperatures. The higher the unit's SEER rating, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER score can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all home appliances.<p>
