<h3>Commercial Boiler Heating Repair in Wadmalaw Island SC</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
