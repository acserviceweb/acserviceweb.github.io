<p>Throughout typical furnace operation, dust, dirt, moisture from humidity or condensation, and microbial developments can develop on internal parts. Airborne elements from normal home products and surfaces can lead to formicary rust within your HVAC devices. Left unattended, these issues can result in loss of efficiency and even worse, breakdown of component products and a much shorter furnace life expectancy Gradually, important components like the heat exchanger, burners or blower housing can start wearing away, leading to minimized performance.<p>
<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Maximizing the Efficiency of Your HVAC System in Souderton PA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
