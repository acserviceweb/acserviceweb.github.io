<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very helpful in collecting info on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to momentarily manage the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and used clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future prevention.

<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ may notice undesirable or moldy smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are getting worse, speak with your physician about them. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>

Insulation exposed to sunshine can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside ought to be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
