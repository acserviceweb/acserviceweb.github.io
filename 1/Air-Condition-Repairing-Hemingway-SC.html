Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
