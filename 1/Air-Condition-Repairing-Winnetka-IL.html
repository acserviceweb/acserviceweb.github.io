<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace service technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>A/c unit manufacturers usually make rugged, high quality items. If your a/c stops working, start by checking any merges or breaker. Let the system cool down for about five minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limit switch may have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, located in the compressor's access panel.<p>
