<p>Information provided in this safety guide is based on current clinical and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. Structures continuously evolve as an outcome of the modifications in the environment around them along with the residents, materials, and activities within them. The various surface areas and the air inside a structure are continuously engaging, and this interaction leads to modifications in each. For example, we may see a window as altering slightly over time as it becomes dirty, then is cleaned, builds up dirt again, is cleaned once again, and so on through its life. In fact, the dirt" we see might be evolving as an outcome of the interactions among the moisture, chemicals, and biological products found there.<p>
<p>There are many actions a homeowner can take to choose items that will avoid indoor air issues from happening - a number of them are discussed here. First, use exterior-grade pushed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an option, consider using strong wood products. Second of all, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, ensure that an efficient moisture barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet. If it becomes damp, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated.<p>

<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outside) air to dilute polluted (indoor) air. Local building regulations likely specify the amount (and in some cases quality) of outdoor air that must be continually provided in your structures, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation paired with proper usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be useful in watering down the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>
