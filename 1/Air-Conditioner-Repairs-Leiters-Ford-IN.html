(If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
