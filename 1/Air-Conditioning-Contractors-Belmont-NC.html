A few of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads.

This indicates that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
