When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room.

As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>

<p>I have been using them for many years for my organisations, my own homes and my property clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again. He is honest, trusted, and reasonable on cost. It's tough to discover a sincere AC man and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
