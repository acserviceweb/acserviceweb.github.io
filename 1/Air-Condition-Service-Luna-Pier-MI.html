<p>Often, indoor air quality problems in big commercial structures can not be successfully recognized or fixed without an extensive building examination. These investigations may start with written surveys and telephone assessments in which building private investigators assess the history of occupant signs and structure operation treatments. In some cases, these inquiries might rapidly discover the issue and on-site check outs are unnecessary.<p>
<p>There is no easy response, but many utilize the guideline that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a better solution. If the present system has not incurred other major repairs, is in otherwise outstanding condition, and issues that caused the breakdown can be recognized and remedied, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense as well.<p>
