<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more problems, because some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>

Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER.
