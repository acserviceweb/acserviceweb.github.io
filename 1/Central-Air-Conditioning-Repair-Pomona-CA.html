<p>Central air units are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.
