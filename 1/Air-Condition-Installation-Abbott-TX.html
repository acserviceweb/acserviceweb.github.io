<p>Regular maintenance keeps a furnace working efficiently, according to HVAC experts like Dave Mejean of B&W Plumbing & Heating in Indianapolis. When you're running an HVAC company, you're on board for all the ups and downs that feature owning a high-demand, seasonal organisation. A thoroughly crafted organisation plan for an HVAC company is the primary step to manage those lulls and peaks so your earnings remain healthy year-round.

However, there are times when a simple maintenance call can recognize an issue that will require a considerable financial investment to correct. Then, it's decision time.

The choice to repair or replace is up to you, and frequently it's a matter of comparing the cost to repair, taking into consideration the age of the devices, versus the cost of a new furnace that likely uses greater energy effectiveness and includes warranty protection.<p>
