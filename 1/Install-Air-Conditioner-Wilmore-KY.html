<h3>Air Condition Repairing in Wilmore KY</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
