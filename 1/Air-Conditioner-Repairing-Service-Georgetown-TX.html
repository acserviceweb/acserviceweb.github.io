The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 Â° F and an indoor temp of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
