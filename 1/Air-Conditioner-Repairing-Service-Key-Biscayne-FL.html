If your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning system you require based upon experience or on square video footage alone, relocate to another contractor. Just like measuring the size of an unit required based on BTUs, determining the appropriate size of system for your home also depends on the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
