<p>Great service within 24 hours and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and very comprehensive in explaining what services would be performed.

<p>The predominant health result associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
