<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning system increase. This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

Because a system is installed in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
