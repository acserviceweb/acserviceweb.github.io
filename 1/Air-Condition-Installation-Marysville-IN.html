<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time.

I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis.
