While weatherization is underway, however, steps need to also be taken to minimize pollution from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, homeowners ought to look out to the development of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization steps must not be undertaken till these issues have actually been corrected.<p>
<p>Regularly, indoor air quality problems in big commercial structures can not be successfully recognized or fixed without a comprehensive structure examination. These investigations might begin with written surveys and telephone consultations in which structure investigators examine the history of occupant signs and structure operation procedures. In many cases, these queries may rapidly discover the problem and on-site check outs are unneeded.<p>
