The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems may be belt-driven. When the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips, squealing noises from a belt-drive air handler usually take place. In most cases, the belt is improperly aligned or used and needs replacement. Follow the instructions above under Air conditioning system Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>
