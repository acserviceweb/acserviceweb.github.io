<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. If products with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
