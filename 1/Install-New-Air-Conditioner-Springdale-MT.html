Standing water in humidifiers, cooling units, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can end up being infected with fungis or bacteria and need to be gotten rid of, likewise. In some circumstances, particular testing for radon or for asbestos may be required as part of building tenancy. For instance, in schools asbestos needs to be examined every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Risk Emergency Action Act-AHERA).<p>
