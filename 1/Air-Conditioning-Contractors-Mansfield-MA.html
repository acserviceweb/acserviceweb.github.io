<p>These people have actually been excellent. At a realtor, I sometimes require contractors to give me an opinion for what deal with a home may cost. Recently I required to get in touch with these people two times. They came out rapidly and offered me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my client most likely would not want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the honesty. Integrity isn't just their name, it's an organisation model they take seriously. You men are formally on speed dial. Speak to you quickly.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor sensibly, much of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

Nevertheless, assuming they are set up properly and appropriately looked after, the likelihood of them having problems is little.<p>
