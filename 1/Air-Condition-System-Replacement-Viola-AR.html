<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price great but Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
