<p>Info provided in this safety guide is based upon current clinical and technical understanding of the problems presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries established by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies. The standards do not need you to change your existing central air conditioning systems, and replacement parts and services need to still be offered for your house's systems. The "life-span" of a central air conditioner is about 15 to twenty years. Producers generally continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts readily available and honoring maintenance agreements after the brand-new standard goes into impact.<p>
<p>Increasing energy expenses are not the only reason for high costs. Heating systems typically lose their efficiency as they age, especially if they have not been correctly kept. As a result your oil or natural gas furnace might run longer to supply the very same amount of heat. This will trigger your energy costs to go up. And, all of the cash you pay your energy utility companies every month might be utilized to help you spend for a brand-new, a lot more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating expenses with heating bills from the previous years. If there is a substantial distinction, then it's time to change your furnace.<p>
