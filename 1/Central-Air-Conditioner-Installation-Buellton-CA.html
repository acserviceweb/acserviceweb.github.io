<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot beside the radiators. This generally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your house escape out of the window. Convected heat provides warmth from the floor up throughout the space with no cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>

The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
