<p>Immediate discount rates on high-efficiency heat pump technologies are available to equipment installers, used at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Outstanding Customer Service! Environment Pro is trusted and genuinely cared about us and our circumstance. We got back one evening to a cold home. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came by that very same night. Although he didn't have actually the required replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could try to find and purchase it the next morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely happy to have a heated home again. What's most incredible was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to assist us right before a holiday, however Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily suggest this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate fantastic however Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
