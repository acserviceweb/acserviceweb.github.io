Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase efficiency even further by performing at lower or higher capability depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Underfloor heating is easy to set up, particularly if you make it part of a construct or restoration task. For example, Warmup's StickyMat solution can be installed as a DIY task as it is simple to put down with the electric wire being all pre-spaced and easily attached to the mesh, prepared to be rolled out in place. Plus, there's even an included cleaning benefit as keeping the spaces dust-free is much easier without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>

<p>While radon in water is not an issue in houses served by a lot of public water supplies, it has been found in well water. If you've tested the air in your house and discovered a radon issue, and you have a well, contact a laboratory accredited to measure radiation in water to have your water evaluated. Radon issues in water can be readily repaired. Call your state radon workplace or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more information.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that just a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, however a homeowner doesn't have the tools or skills necessary to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and appropriate airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, however property owners do not have the essential equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ might see musty or undesirable odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are worsening, talk to your doctor about them. But not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for excellent building management.<p>
