And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset.

<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that moisture has to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just asking for mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri.
