<p>Factors that can add to the development of biological contaminants are wet or damp structure materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and improperly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a common illness triggered by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Different fungis and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these impurities can be dispersed into the air and inhaled by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are pets and home plants.<p>
<p>When every year to make sure all the systems are working well, you need to get your HVAC system aesthetically examined at least. This assessment is a crucial aspect of HVAC maintenance. If you don't get your system inspected, you won't see a problem until it quits working in the middle of winter. That's the last thing you desire due to the fact that you will need to hunt for alternative heating sources until the system is repaired. Regular examination and maintenance also helps keep it in good shape and extends its life.<p>
