<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Don't place the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it since it exhausts warm air out the top. Any air flow limitation will decrease the unit's performance. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are prone to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot next to the radiators.

Convected heat supplies warmth from the floor up throughout the space without any cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>
