<p>Mike B., I'm not so sure of that. I have actually got a bud who operates in security for a company that produces much of the plastic used all over the world, including EMV.

PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the a/c unit into a heat pump While space a/c supplies optimum versatility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is normally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
