<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it very quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
