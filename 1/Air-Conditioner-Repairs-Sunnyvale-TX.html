<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
