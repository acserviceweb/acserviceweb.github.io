<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating units are still commonly used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
