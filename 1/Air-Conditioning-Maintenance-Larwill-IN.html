Similar to other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). COP rates just how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling result. Most ground source heatpump have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every single system of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, approximately 3 to 5 units are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
