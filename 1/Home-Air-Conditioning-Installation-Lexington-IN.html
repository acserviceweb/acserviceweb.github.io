<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.

If we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
