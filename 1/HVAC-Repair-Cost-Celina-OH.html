<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most cost effective if your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>In addition, worker health signs such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, irritation, and irregular breathing may be induced as the outcome of temperature level extremes, inappropriate humidity levels, and insufficient or too much air blood circulation. Work environment temperatures must be kept in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts triggered by too much air blood circulation need to be prevented.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more difficult to control than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
