<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is typically vital to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such details can in some cases be gotten by requesting copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If keeping track of information is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union agent should request that the company have air monitoring tests conducted. Review of this information may recognize potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are extremely low, monitoring data might not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
