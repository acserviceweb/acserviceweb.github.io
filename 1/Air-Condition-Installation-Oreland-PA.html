<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, devices expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning an organisation was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't completion goal. HVAC business owners should pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>
