<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost great but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
