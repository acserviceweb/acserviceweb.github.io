<p>Integrity Energy was quick to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heating systems were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced 2 furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the new furnaces can heat the house. Honestly, our house heating system is complicated, Rob and his team fixed the old duct work, changed all the dampers, make the whole system work completely.<p>
<p>The predominant health impact related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
