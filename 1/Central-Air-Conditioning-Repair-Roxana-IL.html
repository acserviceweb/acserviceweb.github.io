<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage.
