<p>A car's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes old and dirty.

<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit contaminants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
