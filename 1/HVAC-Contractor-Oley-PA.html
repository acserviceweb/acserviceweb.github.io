He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years earlier and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year.
