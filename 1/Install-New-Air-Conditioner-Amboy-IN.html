<p>If you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come other than for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to purchase it. My other half said that she had seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most good individuals I have actually met in a long period of time. We need to support the genuine individuals who are there for us if we desire to have options to ACME heating. Please do.<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely helpful in gathering information on the phone and offering clear directions about how to momentarily handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and used clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began.
