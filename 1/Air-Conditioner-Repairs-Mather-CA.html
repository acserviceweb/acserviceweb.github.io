<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>

Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
