<p>Filters can get filthy quickly, especially if you live in an area that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, debris, bacteria, and clean the air. They are accountable for keeping the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned up and changed regularly, your HVAC system will ultimately stop carrying out as you anticipate it to.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
