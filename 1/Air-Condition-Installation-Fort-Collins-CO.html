<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in Fort Collins CO</h3>
<p>Aspects that can add to the development of biological contaminants are damp or wet structure products (carpets, ceilings, walls) and inadequately kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and ac system. "Humidifier fever" is a common health problem triggered by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Different fungis and bacteria grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these impurities can be dispersed into the air and inhaled by the structure occupants. Other possible sources of biological impurities are pets and household plants.<p>
<p>Many factors affect IAQ. These factors consist of bad ventilation (lack of outdoors air), problems controlling temperature, low or high humidity, current improvement, and other activities in or near a building that can affect the fresh air coming into the building. In some cases, particular contaminants like dust from building or renovation, mold, cleaning supplies, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (including small amounts of chemicals released as a gas in time) may trigger poor IAQ.<p>
