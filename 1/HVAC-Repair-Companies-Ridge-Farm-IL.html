<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and location of toxin exposure. An example of time control is scheduling flooring waxing and removing (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday. This allows products to off-gas over the weekend while most of the staff are at home over the weekend. Place control includes moving the contaminant source far from occupants or even moving susceptible residents.<p>
<p>Our indoor air quality experts can convert your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center. To minimize toxins, we recommend installing innovative air cleaning systems like MicroPower Guard filters, which are created to get rid of the smallest particles from the air. The OxyQuantum UV sanitation systems likewise assist control germs and organic smells. Many store-bought filters can not get rid of these tiniest of allergens and don't eliminate gases and germs.<p>
<p>A/c can create a lot of water since they eliminate wetness from the air. To get rid of this, they have an usually plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To deal with condensate problems, please see Ac system Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
