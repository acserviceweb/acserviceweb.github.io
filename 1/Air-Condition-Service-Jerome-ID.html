All 5 other companies estimated me with various costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me difficulty shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again. He is truthful, reputable, and affordable on rate. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC person and I'm delighted I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
