<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a recommendation in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations.
