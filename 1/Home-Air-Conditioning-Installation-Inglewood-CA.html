<p>It may simply require to be cleaned if your central air conditioner will not cool but you can hear it running. Whether or not this is the cause of the issue, it's a good early solution to attempt.

It doesn't take long to spend $500 simply to keep an old oil or natural gas furnace running. Heating systems incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair indication is whether you had to wait to get parts changed. As a furnace ages, it gets harder to source replacement parts.

A building walk-through to check for smells and try to find water damage, leaks, dirt or insect droppings may be practical. Leaks need to be removed. Standing water in humidifiers, air conditioning units, on roofs and in boiler pans can end up being infected with bacteria or fungi and require to be removed, likewise.

For instance, in schools asbestos needs to be examined every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Risk Emergency Response Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>Outdoor pollutants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens discovered in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Experts suggest utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, but higher MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and typically are better suited for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
