<p>Among the drawbacks of central heating is that it's possibly expensive to set up, especially in an older home. Depending on the kind of unit set up, it can be loud and trigger issues if you're extremely allergic to dust. Additionally, specific fuels and devices might require special licenses, and there is restricted flexibility in the event of changed heating requirements. During use, there is a time delay while heat is being carried from the heating system to the living space.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable higher airflow from the outdoors, air quality monitoring platforms and sensors, and new air filtration technologies are becoming more typical as readily available options in commercial and residential HVAC item packages. Adoption of these technologies, however, has actually not been widespread, as customers stay mostly unconcerned to the results of air quality on health and productivity.<p>

Seattle might be the last city in the country to deal with the reality of a cruel, cruel summer.<p>
