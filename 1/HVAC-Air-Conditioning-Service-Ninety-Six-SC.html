<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Ninety Six SC</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating unit. We decided on getting something more pricey than a conventional water heater as gas is among our biggest utility expenses. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
