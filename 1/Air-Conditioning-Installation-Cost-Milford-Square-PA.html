<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is typically vital to identifying the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such info can in some cases be acquired by requesting copies of air monitoring information from the company. If monitoring information is not readily available, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative must ask for that the company have air monitoring tests conducted. Review of this data may identify possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when impurity concentrations are extremely low, monitoring information might not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
