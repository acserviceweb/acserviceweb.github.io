<p>Both must be kept clean due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to regularly clean up the condenser coil.

If you have actually set up the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
