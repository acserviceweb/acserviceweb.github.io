Not just was the cost fantastic however Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
