<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even little window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
