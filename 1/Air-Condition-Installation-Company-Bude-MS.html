<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
