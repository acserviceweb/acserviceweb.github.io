<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil.
