<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, offices and homes matters, especially considering that we invest most of our lives inside. Ac system help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in exceptionally damp environments or in cases where the air conditioner is large, it might not achieve a low humidity.

Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. However, brand-new installation practices are minimizing costs, to the point where the rate is getting closer to conventional systems under the right conditions.<p>

<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended guarantees or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
