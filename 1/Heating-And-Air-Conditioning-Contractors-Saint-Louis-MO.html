<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat clients relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to effectively service and the system has been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
