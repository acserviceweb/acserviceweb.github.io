<p>A specific ac system that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the very same air course. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. However, since all parts of the dehumidifier are in the very same space, no heat is removed. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is really heated up, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
