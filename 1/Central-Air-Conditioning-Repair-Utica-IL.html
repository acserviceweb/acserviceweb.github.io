Damaging exposures to lead can be developed when lead-based paint is poorly eliminated from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do not accept them up until they have been properly dried. Try a various dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
