<p>I normally don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
