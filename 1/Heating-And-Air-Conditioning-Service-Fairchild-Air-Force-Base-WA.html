<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of heating systems have multiple control panel. The largest, or just one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the brand-new control board must be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t appropriately diagnosed, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable as soon as installed. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the issue, all the while discussing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
