<p>I confess I haven't done the math lately, however I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits.
