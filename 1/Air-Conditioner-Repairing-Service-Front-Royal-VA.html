<h3>Residential HVAC in Front Royal VA</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire.
