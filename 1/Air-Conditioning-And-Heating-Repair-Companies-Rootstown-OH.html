<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical material gradually. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
