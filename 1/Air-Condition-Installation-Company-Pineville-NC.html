<h3>Benefits of Purchasing on Gas Furnaces at Pineville NC</h3>
<p>Your lungs are responsible for bringing fresh air into your body, while concurrently getting rid of waste gases and particulates. Needless to state, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the more difficult it is for your lungs to remove them. Poor air quality - whether it is indoors or outdoors - can make it increasingly difficult for your lungs to function effectively, and can have unfavorable health impacts.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
