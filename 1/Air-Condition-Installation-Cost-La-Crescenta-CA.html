<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in La Crescenta CA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ might notice musty or undesirable odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The objective is to provide enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
