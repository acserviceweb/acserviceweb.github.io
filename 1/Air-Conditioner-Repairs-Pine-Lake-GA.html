<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system".

When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you need to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
