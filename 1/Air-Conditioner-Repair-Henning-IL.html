<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner in Henning IL</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really pleased that someone as experienced as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c unit prior to you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam stated he had methods to check AC systems even in winter. We want we had known him then.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
