It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older unit.<p>

<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
