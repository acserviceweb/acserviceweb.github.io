<p>The likelihood of instant reactions to indoor air contaminants depends on several elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two essential impacts. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a pollutant depends upon private level of sensitivity, which varies tremendously from person to individual.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
