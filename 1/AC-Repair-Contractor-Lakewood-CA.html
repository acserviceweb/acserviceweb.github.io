<h3>Working of an HVAC System in Lakewood CA</h3>
<p>Numerous Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that deals with indoor air quality problems. In the lack of such legislation, the "basic responsibility clause" uses.

<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in loads. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Immediate effects may appear after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue.

Symptoms of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might likewise appear not long after direct exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>
