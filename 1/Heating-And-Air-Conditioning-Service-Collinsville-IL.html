<h3>HVAC Repair Cost in Collinsville IL</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my organisations, my own houses and my realty clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. He helped me problem shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again. He is honest, trusted, and affordable on price. It's hard to discover an honest AC guy and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
