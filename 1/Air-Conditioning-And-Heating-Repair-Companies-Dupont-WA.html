Though specific guidelines have not been developed for IAQ in the work location, the Environment, Health and Safety Department (EHS) considers recommendations from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Cooling Engineers (ASHRAE).<p>

<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company utilized 98% of the existing product acquired with the house. This company introduced a service agreement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and pipes. Throughout the examination on a very cold day they eliminated the furnace claiming health hazard reason and contractor laws for their decision.

On those days when you simply can't seem to heat up and discover you need to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses pulsating. In-floor heating systems are not vulnerable to this concern since they heat surface areas and not the air itself. Moreover, because they do not trust fans, ducts, returns and registers to disperse hot air, in-floor heater can reduce the quantity of dust and seasonal irritants in your house.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was needed and renovated the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater because the professionals thought they simply didn't appear best and they couldn't leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
