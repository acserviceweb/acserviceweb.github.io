<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
