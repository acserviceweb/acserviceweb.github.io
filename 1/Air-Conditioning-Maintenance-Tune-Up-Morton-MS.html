Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>

<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heating systems were not working, integrity Energy was quick to respond. They showed up the next day and replaced 2 furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the new heating systems can heat your home. Truthfully, our home heating system is made complex, Rob and his group repaired the old duct work, altered all the dampers, make the entire system work perfectly.<p>
