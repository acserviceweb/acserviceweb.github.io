<p>I am changing our High Speed System since of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Irritants are materials that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials.

<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is likewise an option for homeowners to think about. Many times, these systems consist of not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, given that the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are usually just readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a great way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the best choice for property owners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
