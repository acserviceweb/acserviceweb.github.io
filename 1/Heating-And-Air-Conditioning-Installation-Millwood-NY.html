<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>

This might be through a public offering, a sale to a big service in the field, or even a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, previously this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for 3 years prior to that.<p>

This can lead to the potential for considerable health problems.<p>
