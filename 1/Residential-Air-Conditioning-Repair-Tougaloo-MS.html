<p>Because a project such as this is going to require a somewhat extensive quantity of work it is recommended that a homeowner request several estimates from a range of contractors.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
