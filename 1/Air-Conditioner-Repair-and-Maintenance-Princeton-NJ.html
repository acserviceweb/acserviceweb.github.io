Without it, you have no cooling. Depending upon its placement on your home and its upkeep, it may sustain some damage throughout the winter season. Most of the time, this just includes some accumulation of dirt and particles, which is quite simple to remove. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will clean off the outside of the unit and guarantee that there is no rust, damage from accumulated wetness, or excessive wear to the outside. They might advise that you trim back thick trees or bushes to make sure sufficient airflow around the system.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
