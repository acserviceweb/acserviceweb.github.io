Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
