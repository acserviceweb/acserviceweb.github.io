<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heat pump, whatever needs to be changed ultimately. As devices ages, it becomes less efficient. Central air conditioning systems and heatpump normally last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last approximately 20 years. If your system is near, or past, its anticipated life expectancy, replacement may be the most cost-effective solution.<p>
