<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Some health impacts can be useful indicators of an indoor air quality issue, especially if they appear after a person relocates to a new home, remodels or refurnishes a house, or deals with a home with pesticides.

You may also wish to speak with an occupational medication or a board-certified allergist expert for answers to your questions.<p>
