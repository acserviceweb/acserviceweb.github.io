<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>I was really happy in the beginning due to the fact that things ran efficiently without any sound. Moreover, I saw obvious modifications in my electrical power bills. After 2 years, things began to change. There have actually been awkward sounds. I got it checked and repaired. I am hoping that is completion of the problem. Overall, it has been a good experience. Trustworthy on the whole. Cool operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its looks in the beginning. However then recognized A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
