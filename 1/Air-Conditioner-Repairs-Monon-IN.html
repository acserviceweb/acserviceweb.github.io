<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, instead of outside or commercial settings. In tasks where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and effectively, but to have two major elements fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

The controls will call for the furnace to come on, effectively heating the house in these conditions.<p>
