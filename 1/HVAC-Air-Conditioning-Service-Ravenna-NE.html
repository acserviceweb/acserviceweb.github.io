<p>When you purchase a new heating and cooling system, you're purchasing your house, your household, and your business.

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO preserve the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor carefully, a number of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the very same).

<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
