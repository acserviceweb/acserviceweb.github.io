<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise homes bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has viewed the single-family house installation company entirely flip on its head the last couple of years.

<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate due to the fact that it just takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>
