<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
