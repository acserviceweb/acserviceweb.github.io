Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has a distinct DNA on how it collects dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how frequently your air conditioning filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a better best choice on how frequently your HVAC filters need changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less frequently you'll have to clean them.

Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>

<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
