In The United States and Canada, split systems are most often seen in residential applications, but they are acquiring popularity in small commercial structures.

Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning a business was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't completion goal. HVAC company owner need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the same in all other locations.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.  Second of all like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly.
