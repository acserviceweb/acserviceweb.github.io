<h3>How Can Air Heat Pump Works at San Clemente CA?</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes a lot more extreme with lower outside temperature levels, so heatpump are frequently set up in tandem with a more traditional type of heating, such as an electrical heater, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heatpump throughout harsher winter temperature levels. In this case, the heatpump is used effectively throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the traditional heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
