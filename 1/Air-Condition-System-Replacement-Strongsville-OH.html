<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with routine preventive maintenance, however, there will always be the odd problem that sometimes shows up. It is very crucial that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as soon as possible when you do see your furnace behaving oddly. The faster you respond to concerns with your furnace, the easier they are to fix. Waiting to require repairs will just make the issue worse, and frequently more costly.<p>

Unclean filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down totally. By comparison, inspecting and replacing a furnace filter can usually be carried out in just a couple of minutes, typically without any tools needed. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
