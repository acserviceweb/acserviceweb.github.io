<p>Acknowledged as a leader in the HVAC industry, Bard Manufacturing combines quality items and exceptional service with innovation and technological advances to provide high-performance heating and cooling products around the world. A multi-split system 56 is a traditional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and permits cooling or heating of several rooms with one external system. In the outdoor unit of this air conditioning system there is a more powerful compressor, ports for linking several traces and automation with locking valves for regulating the volume of refrigerant supplied to the indoor units found in the space.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system components, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>

<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems in Richmond VA</h3>

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air helps and waters down indoor impurities tire them from the home.<p>
