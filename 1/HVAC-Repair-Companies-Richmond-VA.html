A multi-split system 56 is a traditional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and permits cooling or heating of several rooms with one external system. In the outdoor unit of this air conditioning system there is a more powerful compressor, ports for linking several traces and automation with locking valves for regulating the volume of refrigerant supplied to the indoor units found in the space.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>

The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air helps and waters down indoor impurities tire them from the home.<p>
