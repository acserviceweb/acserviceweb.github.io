Modern 2- and three-stage heaters increase performance even further by running at lower or greater capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
