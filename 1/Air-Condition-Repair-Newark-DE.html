<p>Sean was very helpful. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to buy extra stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>

<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning units is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions.
