<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the flooring level.

Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage.

Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no issues aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
