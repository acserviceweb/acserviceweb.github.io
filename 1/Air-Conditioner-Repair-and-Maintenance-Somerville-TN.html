<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
