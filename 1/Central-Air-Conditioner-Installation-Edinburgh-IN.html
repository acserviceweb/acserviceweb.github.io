The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>
