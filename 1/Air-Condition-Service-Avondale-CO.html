<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment.

When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat.

<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a distribution system. Metal pipes are hardly ever utilized due to long-lasting corrosive issues. Virtually all hydronic glowing floor heat systems today use 1/2 inch diameter plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is highly versatile, will not rust and comes in long lengths, which allow PEX pipe to be woven with very little or no joints.<p>
<p>When it comes to heated water or steam, piping is used to transfer the heat to the rooms. A lot of contemporary hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the distribution system (instead of older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air using radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators might be mounted on walls or installed within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>
