<h3>Best Portable Air Conditioner in Harrison AR</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
