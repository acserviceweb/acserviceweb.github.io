<p>Cooling can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
