<p>We called Elite HEATING AND COOLING on among the most popular days of summer( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out exact same day to assess situation & chose to choose them for the work. I more than happy to say that not only did we get the central air conditioning going however also changed the heating system which was old. Everybody we spoke with from beginning to end were really expert, polite and the work was very efficiently done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>

<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might wish to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump units can have various heating and cooling capabilities. You might look for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capability and effectiveness if you already have a home heating system. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to look for a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one significant drawback of heatpump is that they can fail in the exceptionally hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
<p>The majority of companies utilize third party service warranty companies - not YORK. YORK products are backed by a few of the very best restricted service warranties in the business, consisting of YORK's factory-backed service warranty.
