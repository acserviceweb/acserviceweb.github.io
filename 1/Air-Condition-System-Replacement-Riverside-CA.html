Others were almost two times the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex effectively encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install group was considerate of my house and installed the equipment in the expected amount of time. post install examination outcomes look great for braising and plumbing quality.
