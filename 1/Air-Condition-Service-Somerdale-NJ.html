The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most budget friendly. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
