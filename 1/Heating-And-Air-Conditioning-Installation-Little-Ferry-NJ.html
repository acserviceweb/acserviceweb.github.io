Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperatures sometimes used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the United States and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to offer thermal comfort inside your home. However, high humidity outdoors creates the need for cautious attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities trigger mold growth and moisture inside your home is related to a greater frequency of occupant breathing issues.<p>
