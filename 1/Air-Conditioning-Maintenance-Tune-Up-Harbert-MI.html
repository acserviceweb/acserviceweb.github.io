The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor pollutants and assists exhaust them from the house.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't release heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur over time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to suffice till you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
