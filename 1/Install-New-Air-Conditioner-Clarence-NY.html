<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
