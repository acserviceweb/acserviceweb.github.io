<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide need to be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be essential.<p>
