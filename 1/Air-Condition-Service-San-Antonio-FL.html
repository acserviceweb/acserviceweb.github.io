<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the a/c into a heat pump While room cooling offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is generally more expensive than central air.<p>
