Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
