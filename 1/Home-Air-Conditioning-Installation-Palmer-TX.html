Many producers state on service warranty paperwork that installation and maintenance by a certified HVAC service provider are a part of the service warranty conditions. When you have a ten-year parts limited service warranty as is standard on Carrier ® heating systems, you'll want to be sure you keep that coverage legitimate for the complete 10 years.<p>
