Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to offer auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There should not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Recent Review: They were excellent! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally asked for. They met my needs completely by supplying a professional quote with options, without pushing additional items. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also without delay followed up with the required examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
