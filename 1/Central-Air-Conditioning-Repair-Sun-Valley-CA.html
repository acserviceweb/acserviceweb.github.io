Additionally, particular fuels and equipment might require unique permits, and there is limited versatility in case of altered heating requirements. During use, there is a dead time while heat is being transported from the heating system to the living space.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
