Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
