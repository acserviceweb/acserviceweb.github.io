<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source.

The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
