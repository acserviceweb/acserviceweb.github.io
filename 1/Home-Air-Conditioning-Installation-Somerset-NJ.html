<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it very rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>

<p>No matter the type of electric radiant floor heating unit, all are factory-built to remain in one piece and not cut, broken or changed.

However, assuming they are installed properly and effectively taken care of, the probability of them having problems is small.<p>
