They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity expert at a large retailer who asked not to be called due to the fact that he did not have permission to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a team that consistently keeps track of energy consumption and temperatures in shops to minimize costs (especially at night) and to alert store managers if temperatures in the stores change outside of an appropriate range that could avoid customers from shopping at the shop.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol result, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may get in close-by ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and assisted living home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor water fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
