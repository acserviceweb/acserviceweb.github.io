<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. However, many of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product.

<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Finly IN Home Owners</h3>
