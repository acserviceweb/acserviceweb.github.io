<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures via mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products consist of vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. When they are managed in a way that develops dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be inhaled, these products provide a risk only. When asbestos-containing materials are damaged or disrupted by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can end up being airborne if correct controls are not in place. This can lead to the capacity for considerable illness.<p>
