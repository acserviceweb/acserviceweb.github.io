The average house's ductwork leakages 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your living space, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before choosing whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower units, your technician needs to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining how much air leaves the system.<p>
