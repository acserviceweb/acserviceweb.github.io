<h3>Typical HVAC Services Offered with a San Marino CA HVAC Company</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in house construction is to decrease air leak through cracks and other openings in roofs, walls, and floorings. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the home.<p>
