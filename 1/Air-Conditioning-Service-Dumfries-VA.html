<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young children can be extreme. They consist of hold-ups in physical and psychological advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Infants, children, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups because lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more conscious the damaging results of lead. Kids may have greater exposures given that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

<p>The most dangerous asbestos fibers are too little to be visible. After they are inhaled, they can build up and stay in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (irreparable lung scarring that can be fatal). Symptoms of these illness do not show up till many years after direct exposure started. Many people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to elevated concentrations on the job; some developed illness from direct exposure to clothes and equipment brought house from task websites.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Most well and city water does not usually contain lead. Water generally gets lead inside the house from family plumbing that is made with lead products. If there is lead in drinking water is to have it evaluated, the only method to know. Contact the local health department or the water provider to learn how to get the water tested. Send for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to find out more about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more information.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might wish to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump units can have various heating and cooling capacities. You may look for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capability and performance if you currently have a house heating system. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to try to find a design that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winters. The bright side is that the one major disadvantage of heatpump is that they can fail in the incredibly hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
<p>Depending upon where in the United States your home is located, the local area's environment can change drastically. A home situated in the South would require an AC system with a size capable of cooling your home due to heat Summers. A house in the Northern part of the United States would need a much larger heating capacity too which will impact costs. See the chart below for the average central air conditioning conditioner replacement expenses by LOTS.<p>
