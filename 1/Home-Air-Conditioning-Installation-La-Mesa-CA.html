<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Because it tires warm air out the top, don't place the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it. Any airflow limitation will lower the system's performance. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are prone to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot beside the radiators. This typically results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up the house escape out of the window. Convected heat offers heat from the floor up throughout the room without any cold areas or stuffiness in the location being warmed.<p>
