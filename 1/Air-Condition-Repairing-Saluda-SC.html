<p>Reality: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly uncommon now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>The majority of people do not recognize that the HVAC connections and systems can come loose or break gradually. That can jeopardize the efficiency of the system and ultimately damage it enough that you need to purchase furnace replacement or AC replacement. The maintenance technician will thoroughly take a look at the connections and assess the performance of the system. They'll search for frayed and harmed wires and change them in order to lessen the danger of fire and component failure.<p>

<p>I typically don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best aspect of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers guarantee would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Likewise they identified the problem and repaired extremely rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
