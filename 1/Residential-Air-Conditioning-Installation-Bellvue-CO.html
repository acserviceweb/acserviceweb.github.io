<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity professional at a large merchant who asked not to be called because he did not have authorization to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a group that routinely monitors energy usage and temperatures in stores to save on costs (especially during the night) and to alert store managers if temperature levels in the stores vary beyond an acceptable range that might avoid consumers from shopping at the store.<p>

On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to correctly cool the home on hot days. Considering larger systems cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
