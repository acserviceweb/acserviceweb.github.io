<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating systems, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components.
