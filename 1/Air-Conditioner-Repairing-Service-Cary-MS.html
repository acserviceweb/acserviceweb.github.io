<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce toxins.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, wall, ceiling, and floor coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to two days may become a source for mold growth and should be discarded. In some cases there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can thrive in surprise or rarely accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products including carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Repair the wetness problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the area utilizing recognized health department recommendations.<p>
