<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists if no impurity sources are found. Extreme re-circulation of air results in "stale air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not adequate to account for an increase in the number of employees in the location, stale air might also be a problem.<p>
<p>Legionella is a parasite of protozoans such as amoeba, and therefore requires conditions appropriate for both organisms. The germs forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, consisting of chlorine. Remediation for Legionella outbreaks in commercial buildings differ, but often include extremely warm water flushes (160 ° F; 70 ° C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and in some cases flushes of heavy metal salts. Preventive measures consist of adjusting typical warm water levels to allow for 120 ° F( 50 ° C )at the tap, examining center design layout, getting rid of faucet aerators, and routine testing in suspect locations.<p>
