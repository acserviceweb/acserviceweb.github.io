<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
