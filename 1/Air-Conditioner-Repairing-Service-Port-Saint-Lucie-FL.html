<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day.

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product in time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
