<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Raleigh MS</h3>
<p>Many people are aware that outdoor air pollution can affect their health, but indoor air pollution can also have considerable, harmful impact.

For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by lots of people.<p>
