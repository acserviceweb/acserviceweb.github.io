<h3>Furnace Cleaning in Catawba VA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me regarding an unusually high expense that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of concern. Ron had actually found the trouble area in looking over the bill. He dealt with the concern in one day, had actually changed the costs to what I thought about reasonable before he called back, knew what might have triggered the issue and had a plan to guarantee that it would not take place once again. I have actually considered All Points a company with stability for the 9 years we have actually utilized them. This experience validates that.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were great! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially requested. They fulfilled my requirements entirely by supplying an expert quote with choices, without pressing additional items. The team appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The also immediately followed up with the needed assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
