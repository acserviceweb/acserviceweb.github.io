A multi-split system 56 is a standard split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and allows cooling or heating of a number of rooms with one external system. In the outdoor system of this ac system there is a more powerful compressor, ports for linking a number of traces and automation with locking valves for controling the volume of refrigerant supplied to the indoor units located in the room.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your house won't heat up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
