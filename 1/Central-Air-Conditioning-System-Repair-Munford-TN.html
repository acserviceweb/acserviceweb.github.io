<p>When mounting a wall sensing unit, consider the height at which they must be placed. Most frequently they are installed at height-level or a little lower, if individuals mostly remain seated in that particular area. Nevertheless, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate towards the flooring or ceiling; depending upon what contaminant you're trying to track you'll need to position the sensor accordingly.
