The decreased airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged.

<h3>Commercial Boiler Heating Repair in Pine Grove PA</h3>
<p>The residential or commercial properties and structure of the soil in an area can affect the rate at which heat is conducted through the ground. These need to be taken into account before choosing the very best design of an underground heating and cooling system. Soil with positive heat transfer homes requires fewer pipelines to achieve the desired underground heating and cooling effect, while those with minimized thermal conductivity will require more pipelines.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated by radiators are susceptible to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot beside the radiators. This generally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up the house escape out of the window. Convected heat supplies heat from the flooring up throughout the space without any cold spots or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>
