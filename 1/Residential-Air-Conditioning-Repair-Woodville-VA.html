My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the exact same. When the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly treat and solidify-- typically 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
