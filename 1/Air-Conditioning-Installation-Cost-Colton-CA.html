<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as a Vital Service in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are ranked 90% performance or better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective.

Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase effectiveness even further by performing at lower or higher capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Photo 6).<p>

Zones are controlled by multiple thermostats. In water heating unit the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is really vital to maintaining a correct temperature level.<p>
