<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER rating of a system is the cooling output at varying temperatures during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the same period. Basically, SEER supplies more data based on how the EER carries out in different temps.
