<p>Geographically, some areas pay consistently greater earnings for air conditioning tradesmen. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable climate, or simply a high level of competitors for competent trades.

The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year.
