<p>A specialized air conditioner that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioner because both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the very same air path. A basic air conditioning unit transfers heat out of the space since its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, considering that all components of the dehumidifier are in the same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is in fact warmed, just as by an electric heater that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
