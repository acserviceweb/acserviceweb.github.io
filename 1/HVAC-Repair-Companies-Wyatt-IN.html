<p>While radon in water is not an issue in homes served by the majority of public water supplies, it has actually been found in well water.

Radon issues in water can be readily repaired. Call your state radon workplace or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to learn more.<p>
<p>I am changing our High Velocity System since of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>The split system is the most typical. Most people are used to seeing this enter the yards of houses. With split system units, the majority of the components are housed in a metal box outside of the home. Nevertheless, there are some internal parts as well. Split systems are ideal for cooling several rooms simultaneously, but are not very energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud devices in the home. At the very same time, the con would be that those who utilize this might spend more money on cooling costs in the long run because of the lower energy efficiency.<p>
<p>Many companies use third party service warranty companies - not YORK. YORK items are backed by some of the best restricted service warranties in business, including YORK's factory-backed service warranty. Since these guarantees lead the HVAC industry in covering parts and key mechanical components, you can feel confident knowing you have actually chosen the best furnace and air conditioning system for your house or service.<p>
