<p>Though it might be tough to think, the air inside your home can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are notorious for decreasing the air quality in your house, but there are numerous other contaminants that can not only unclean up the air, but cause other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and building products add to bad air quality, and can likewise cause cancers. VOCs (unstable natural compounds) from paint and even from some kinds of carpeting and upholstery materials can trigger problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>Air pollutants can range from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your pets to hazardous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a common air pollutant resulting from gas that leaves into your home without being burnt. Older homes might include asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In restrooms and kitchen areas, mold and mildew can end up being a problem where moisture levels are typically greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The objective is to provide enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A common component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
