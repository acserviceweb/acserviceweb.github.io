<p>Unstable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from processes or items; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items include vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. When they are handled in a method that creates dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be inhaled, these products present a risk only. When asbestos-containing materials are damaged or disturbed by repair, renovating, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can end up being air-borne if correct controls are not in place. This can result in the potential for considerable illness.<p>
