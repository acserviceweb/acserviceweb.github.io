<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
