<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity professional at a large seller who asked not to be named due to the fact that he did not have approval to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a team that regularly keeps an eye on energy usage and temperatures in stores to save on expenses (especially at night) and to alert shop managers if temperature levels in the stores vary beyond an acceptable range that might prevent clients from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your house that ideal temperature all year round.
