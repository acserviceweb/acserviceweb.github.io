<h3>How Central Heating Boilers Maintain Your Star City IN Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to remove the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heater. We chose getting something more costly than a standard water heater as gas is among our biggest utility costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run. An oversize compressor also costs more to run because it simply takes more electricity to run a bigger system. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down prior to it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>

<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance products that only a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in pricey compressor failure, but a house owner doesn't have the tools or skills necessary to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and proper air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the needed devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still required to have a professional technician check the system periodically.<p>
