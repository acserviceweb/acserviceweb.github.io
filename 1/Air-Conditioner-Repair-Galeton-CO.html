<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do not accept them until they have been appropriately dried. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
