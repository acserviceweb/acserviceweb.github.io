As a society, we ensure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, however we don't think sufficient about direct exposure to all the things we put in our homes," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and structures has a big effect on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea-- immediately, they can begin years after direct exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA).

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
