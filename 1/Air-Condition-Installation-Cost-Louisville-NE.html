<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep.

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
