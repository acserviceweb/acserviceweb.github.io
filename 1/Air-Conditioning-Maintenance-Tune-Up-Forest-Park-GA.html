<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Contractors in Forest Park</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. However, a number of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
