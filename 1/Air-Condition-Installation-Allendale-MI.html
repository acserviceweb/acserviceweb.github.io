<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor appliances through codes, and after more powerful guidelines are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that allow higher airflow from the outside, air quality monitoring platforms and sensing units, and brand-new air purification technologies are becoming more common as available options in commercial and residential HVAC product bundles. Adoption of these technologies, however, has actually not been prevalent, as customers remain largely unconcerned to the results of air quality on health and performance.<p>
<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick up until you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
