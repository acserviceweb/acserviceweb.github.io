<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Companies in Dawson</h2>

<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. Simply including refrigerant is not an option if it leaks. A skilled technician must fix any leak, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the right amount of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the efficiency and performance of your air conditioner is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the producer's requirements, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be harmful to the environment.<p>
