<h3>HVAC Repair Companies in Drayton Plains MI</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer malfunctions, your Nest won't begin. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that safeguard your cooling system from flooding. Among the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic. The water activates your emergency safety switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on uncommon events.<p>
