<p>When you and your household walk into your house in Sacramento, CA, are you as comfy as you can be? Do you find it to be either too cold throughout the winter season or too warm in locations during the summer?

Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
