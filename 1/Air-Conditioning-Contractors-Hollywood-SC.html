<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Hollywood SC?</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing trend in house building is to lower air leakage through cracks and other openings in walls, roofing systems, and floorings. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air assists and dilutes indoor pollutants tire them from the house.<p>

<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals utilized in the building or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these home appliances (cook stoves, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops must be utilized with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating appliances need to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to eliminate products of incomplete combustion.
