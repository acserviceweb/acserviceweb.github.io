<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from products or processes; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.)

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical product with time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
