Depending on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a house can be heated in cooler months by moving and condensing energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels found simply a few feet listed below ground. In the summer season, the process reverses, thereby cooling a house by eliminating heat.

<p>Air conditioning unit can create a lot of water due to the fact that they eliminate moisture from the air. To get rid of this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In truth, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location.
