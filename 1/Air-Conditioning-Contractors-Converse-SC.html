<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you must check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
