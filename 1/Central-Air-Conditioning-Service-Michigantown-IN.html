<p>Sean was really helpful. He is a really pleasant person to work with. No pressure applied to purchase additional things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Do not position the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top. Any airflow constraint will lower the unit's efficiency. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that determine the height and width of the opening. Be sure to have those dimensions on hand when shopping for an a/c unit to ensure it'll fit conveniently into the window. Likewise, keep fire safety in mind when choosing where to install the a/c unit: Do not place it in an egress window that acts as the only ways of escape must a fire emerge.<p>
