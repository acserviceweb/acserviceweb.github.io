Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as merely radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, occasionally linked to terminal systems like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout the house.
