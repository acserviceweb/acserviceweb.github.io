<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost excellent but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
