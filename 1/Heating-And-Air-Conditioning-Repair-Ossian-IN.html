<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
