<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
