<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you need to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
