<h3>Air Condition Repair in Ixonia WI</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Terrific service within 24 hr and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was really extensive and on-time in explaining what services would be performed. Also Camryn supplied excellent customer support at the end of the consultation by discussing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few suggestions of some maintenance tasks we may wish to have done in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale tactics employed by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ may discover musty or undesirable smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are getting worse, speak with your doctor about them. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
