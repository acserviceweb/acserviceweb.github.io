<p>How environment change impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern a/c) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system boost. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
