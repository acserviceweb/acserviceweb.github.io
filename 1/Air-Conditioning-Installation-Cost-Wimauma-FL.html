<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two different systems (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioner into a heat pump While room a/c supplies maximum flexibility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is normally more expensive than central air.<p>
