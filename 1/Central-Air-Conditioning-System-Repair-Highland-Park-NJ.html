<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
