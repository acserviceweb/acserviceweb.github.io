<p>Ask about training and certifications. A great place to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's type of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there have not bothered with it!

<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more tough to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>Think about potential effects of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit. Follow the manufacturer's directions, especially instructions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating system effectively changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is normally an indicator of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While a space heating unit is in usage, open a door from the space where the heating unit is located to the rest of the house and open a window a little.<p>
