Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
