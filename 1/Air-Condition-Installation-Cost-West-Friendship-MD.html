<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
