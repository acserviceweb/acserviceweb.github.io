<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price great but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced.

<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is a really pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to buy extra stuff. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>

<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best feature of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they diagnosed the concern and fixed really quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Stability Energy fasted to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heaters were not working. They showed up the next day and replaced two heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the brand-new furnaces can heat your home. Honestly, our home heater is complicated, Rob and his team repaired the old duct work, changed all the dampers, make the whole system work perfectly.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement attempts to upsell you whenever they come to carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for seven years, even though it was six months prior to the existing one expired. She didn't require a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
