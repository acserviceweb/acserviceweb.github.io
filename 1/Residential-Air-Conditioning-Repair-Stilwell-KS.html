<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the task based just on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of affordable ones got. Others were almost two times the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install group was respectful of my house and installed the devices in the expected quantity of time. post install examination outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality.
