<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in Phillipsburg MO</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my organisations, my own houses and my realty clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is truthful, trustworthy, and sensible on price. It's difficult to find a sincere AC person and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance items that just an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in costly compressor failure, but a property owner doesn't have the skills or tools essential to check refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and correct airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, however house owners do not have the needed devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still necessary to have an expert technician check the system regularly.<p>

<p>Central air conditioners, often described as central air" or split-system a/c", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the floors, walls, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning system to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
