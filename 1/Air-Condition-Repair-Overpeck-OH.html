Others were nearly two times the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex correctly recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install team was respectful of my house and set up the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up inspection outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New system cools far better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 system it replaced (also Provider).<p>
