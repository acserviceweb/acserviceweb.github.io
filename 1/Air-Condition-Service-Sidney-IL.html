<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run because it has to run longer than a correctly sized system.

The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In reality, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
