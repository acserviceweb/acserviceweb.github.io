<h3>Ductless Heating And Cooling in Goodwine Illinois</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, however to have 2 major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

And if it's too small, you will not get warm or enough cool air to keep you comfy.<p>
