<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise considering that 1978. The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their overall power should not go beyond the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units higher than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, considering that the total capability of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outside system. Put simply, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms might not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not easy, because it takes into account not only the small power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as merely radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating components installed in the subfloor of each room in the house, periodically connected to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heating.<p>

<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
