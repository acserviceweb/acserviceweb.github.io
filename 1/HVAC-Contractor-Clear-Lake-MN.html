<p>As a number of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices producer's to guarantee your factory warranties stay in location. Additionally, the concrete results of a PM is typically difficult to quantify, as one response stated the cost savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. A lot of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system do not simply break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the outcome of repeated usage of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering early deterioration, resulting in cracks and holes. If that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the component.  an extremely useful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
