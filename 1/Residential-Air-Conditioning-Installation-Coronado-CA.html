<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same. As soon as the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly solidify and treat-- typically 2 to four weeks.
