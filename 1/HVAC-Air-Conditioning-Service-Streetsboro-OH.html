<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
