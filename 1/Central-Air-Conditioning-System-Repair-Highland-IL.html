Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
