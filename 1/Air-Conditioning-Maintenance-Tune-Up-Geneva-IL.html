<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
