<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
