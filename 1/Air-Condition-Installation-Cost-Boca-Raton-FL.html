<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
