<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor unit instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit.

<h3>Furnace Replacement in Oxford GA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
