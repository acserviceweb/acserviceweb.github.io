<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter.

<p>Finally, if you do identify a particularly energy-efficient in-floor heater and choose to install it in your house, you might be eligible for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor expenses. (And these costs can be considerable. According to figures collected by Angie's List, house owners can expect to pay in between $6 and $16 per square foot, not consisting of tax and labor, for a radiant heating system.)

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
