<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on.

<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Caseyville IL</h3>
<p>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside your home. The majority of home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window a/c unit with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors get rid of contaminants straight from the space where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
