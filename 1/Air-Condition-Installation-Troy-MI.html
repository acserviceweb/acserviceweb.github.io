(If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor.

Prior to that takes place, you want to get those capacitors altered to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
