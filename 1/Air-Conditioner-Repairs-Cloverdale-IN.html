<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation.

There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A typical element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
