<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems in homes.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire.
