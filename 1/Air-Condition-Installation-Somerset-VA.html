If your air conditioning system is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. If it leaks, merely adding refrigerant is not an option. A qualified technician needs to repair any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the right amount of refrigerant.

Since an unit is installed in each room or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
