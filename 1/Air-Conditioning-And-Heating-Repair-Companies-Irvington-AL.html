<p>Devices costs are driven by the type of furnace at the heart of your house heater. Low-efficiency designs will cost less, but lead to higher energy costs. High-efficiency designs cost more, but save more over the long run. Prices for gas heating systems range from $1,360 for the low-efficiency designs up to $12,500 for high-efficiency designs. Electric furnaces begin at $395 and range as much as $1,700 or more depending on the brand name and furnace size.<p>
<p>The main reason property owners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the amount of services used.
