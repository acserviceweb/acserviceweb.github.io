<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment maker's to guarantee your factory guarantees remain in location. In addition, the concrete results of a PM is typically difficult to quantify, as one response stated the savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system do not just break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the result of repeated usage of a component that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, resulting in holes and fractures. , if that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and secures the part.. a really useful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
