<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system parts, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
