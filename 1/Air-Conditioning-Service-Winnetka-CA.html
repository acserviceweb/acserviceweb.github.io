<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC system than a smaller home, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>There are many things to take into account when attempting to find out how often I should change my a/c filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 home has an unique DNA on how it accumulates dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how typically your a/c filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a better best choice on how often your HVAC filters need changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less typically you'll need to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with only one a/c filter require changing more often.<p>
