<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. Because it merely takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a possibility to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
