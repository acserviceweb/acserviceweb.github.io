<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roofing system, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, but it is also a choice for house owners to consider. Often times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those wanting to save money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, given that the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are normally just readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best choice for house owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
