<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside system as near to your home as possible per my demand.

Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
