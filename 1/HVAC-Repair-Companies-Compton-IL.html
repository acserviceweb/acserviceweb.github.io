<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI affirmed before the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set more powerful indoor standards based on the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor appliances through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. A great location to begin is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's type of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, however a great deal of contractors out there haven't troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Structure Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Managers with BPI certification understand that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as just one element (out of many) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>Think about a whole house dehumidifier if your single phase air conditioner isn't old sufficient to validate replacement. By installing dehumidification equipment inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy some of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without replacing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, improving indoor air quality and making it possible for greater convenience at higher temperatures.<p>

The Bbb is an excellent place to look for consumer satisfaction. The best HVAC company will be devoted to making customers pleased.
