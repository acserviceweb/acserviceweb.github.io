<p>IAQ can be impacted by gases (including carbon monoxide gas, radon, unpredictable organic compounds ), particulates, microbial contaminants (mold, germs ), or any mass or energy stressor that can induce adverse health conditions. Source control, filtering and the use of ventilation to dilute contaminants are the primary methods for enhancing indoor air quality in a lot of buildings.

<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company.

You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and need to not "require" to offer you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on.

However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker journeys.
