<p>Fantastic service within 24 hr and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was very extensive and on-time in describing what services would be performed.

He made a couple of suggestions of some maintenance jobs we might wish to have actually carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics used by some in the industry.<p>
