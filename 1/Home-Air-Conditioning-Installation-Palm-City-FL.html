<p>Check these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The reduced airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the issue.<p>
