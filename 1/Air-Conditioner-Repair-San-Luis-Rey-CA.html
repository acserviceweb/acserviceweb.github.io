Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
