Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your home will not warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

When checking your air conditioning devices to turn off all main power from the emergency breaker panel or detach switch, constantly make sure.

<p>Air conditioners can create a lot of water because they get rid of moisture from the air. To eliminate this, they have an usually plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To handle condensate issues, please see Air Conditioner Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
