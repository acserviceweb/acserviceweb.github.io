<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut down completely.<p>
