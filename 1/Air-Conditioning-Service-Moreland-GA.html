<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Moreland GA</h3>
<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of exchanging or replacing air in any space to offer high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of wetness, odors, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne germs, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates unpleasant smells and extreme wetness, introduces outside air, keeps interior structure air distributing, and avoids stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>While toxin levels from specific sources may not pose a significant health threat on their own, most homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air pollution. There can be a severe danger from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Thankfully, there are actions that many people can take both to decrease the danger from existing sources and to avoid new problems from taking place. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Item Safety Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to do something about it that can lower the level of indoor air contamination in your own house.<p>
<p>Before you go out and buy an a/c unit, there are a couple of things to decide first. Where are you going to be setting up the ac system? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioner be? Too big and you'll encounter issues with short-cycling, which can harm the ac system and shorten its life. Too little and your air conditioning unit will not be able to cool the house correctly. When going shopping for a new AC system, these are simply a few of the aspects that you need to take into account. Each choice can and will considerably impact your system's performance, which is why you can't afford to ignore any of them.<p>
