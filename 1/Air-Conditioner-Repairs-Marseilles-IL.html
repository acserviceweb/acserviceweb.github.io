<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a service was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it took to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't completion goal. HVAC business owners should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping costs the very same in all other locations.<p>
