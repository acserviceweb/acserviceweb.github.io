<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Maintenance in Roberts Illinois</h3>

The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
