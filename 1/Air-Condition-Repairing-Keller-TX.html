<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Keller TX Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing pattern in home building and construction is to minimize air leak through fractures and other openings in walls, roofing systems, and floorings. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
