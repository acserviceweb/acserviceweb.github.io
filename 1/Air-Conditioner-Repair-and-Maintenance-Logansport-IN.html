<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
