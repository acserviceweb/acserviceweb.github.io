<h3>HVAC Repair Free Estimates in Plainfield NJ</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your house that perfect temperature level throughout the year.

So, be sure to change your AC filters frequently, or get an a/c service plan which usually consists of a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
