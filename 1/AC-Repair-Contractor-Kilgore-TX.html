<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The split system is the most common. Many people are used to seeing this key in the backyards of houses. With split system units, most of the elements are housed in a metal box beyond the home. However, there are some internal elements also. Split systems are perfect for cooling several spaces at the same time, however are not very energy effective. Therefore, one pro is not having loud devices in the home. At the very same time, the con would be that those who use this may invest more cash on cooling expenses in the long run since of the lower energy efficiency.<p>
