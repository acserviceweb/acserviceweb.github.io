<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not provide auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to offer car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There must not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
