<p>Asthmatic kids are specifically at risk. EPA estimates that exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and might cause countless nonasth-matic kids to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition made worse by direct exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Exposure to previously owned smoke causes eye, nose, and throat inflammation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually linked direct exposure to secondhand smoke with the onset of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
