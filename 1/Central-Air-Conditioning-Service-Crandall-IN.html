<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts years, given that it is protected inside. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical guidelines eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
