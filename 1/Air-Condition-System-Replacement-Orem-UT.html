If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil.

The next action is to defrost your air conditioning devices if you found that your conditioning filter needs replacing. The simplest way to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the system off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
