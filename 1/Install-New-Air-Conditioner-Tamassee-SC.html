<p>Regular maintenance keeps a furnace working effectively, according to HVAC specialists like Dave Mejean of B&W Pipes & Heating in Indianapolis. When you're running an HVAC company, you're on board for all the ups and downs that come with owning a high-demand, seasonal business. A thoroughly crafted business plan for an HVAC company is the first step to manage those peaks and lulls so your profits remain healthy year-round. If you didn't produce a heating and cooling company strategy when you started your service, it's not too late to develop one now, or to give your original plan an upgrade.<p>
<p>A regular furnace tune up can optimize performance and provide longer lasting house heating. However, there are times when an easy maintenance call can determine an issue that will need a considerable investment to correct. Then, it's choice time. Do you make the pricey repair and enjoy ongoing comfort from your existing heating system? Or, do you make an even larger monetary dedication to changing the furnace? The decision to repair or replace depends on you, and typically it's a matter of comparing the cost to repair, taking into account the age of the equipment, versus the cost of a new furnace that likely uses higher energy efficiency and comes with service warranty protection.<p>
