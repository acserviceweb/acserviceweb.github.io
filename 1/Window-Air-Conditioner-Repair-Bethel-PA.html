This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between a outdoor and indoor system instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality problems are not restricted to houses. In reality, numerous office buildings have substantial air pollution sources Some of these buildings might be inadequately ventilated. For instance, mechanical ventilation systems may not be developed or operated to provide adequate amounts of outdoor air. Finally, individuals normally have less control over the indoor environment in their offices than they perform in their homes. As a result, there has actually been a boost in the incidence of reported illness.<p>
