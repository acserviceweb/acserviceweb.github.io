<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical product with time.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
