<p>Forced air systems are the most typical heater types on the market, however they're not always the best choice for each home.

<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
