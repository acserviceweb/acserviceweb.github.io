<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a service was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners should pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the exact same in all other locations.<p>
