<p>I am very amazed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years ago and understand the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
