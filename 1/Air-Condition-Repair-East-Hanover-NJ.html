A furnace that is too small, on the other hand, will not be able to supply sufficient heat to keep your home comfortable.<p>

High concentrations of airborne lead particles in houses can also result from lead dust from outside sources, including contaminated soil tracked inside, and usage of lead in particular indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
