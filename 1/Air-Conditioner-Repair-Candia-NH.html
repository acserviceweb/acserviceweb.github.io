<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise given that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power needs to not exceed the capacity of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect much better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, given that the overall capability of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor system. Put simply, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that a few of the spaces may not have a really comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the total power is not easy, because it takes into account not just the small power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
