<p>When installing a wall sensing unit, consider the height at which they should be positioned. A lot of commonly they are installed at height-level or slightly lower, if people mainly remain seated in that particular location.

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material in time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
