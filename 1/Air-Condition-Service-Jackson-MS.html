<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<p>Oil heating systems are typically not very efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, however a lot of do not achieve a performance greater than 90%.
