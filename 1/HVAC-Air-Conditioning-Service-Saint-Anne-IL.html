<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your house that ideal temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those typical air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job.

So, make sure to change your AC filters frequently, or get a cooling service plan which normally includes a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
