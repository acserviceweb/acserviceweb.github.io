Bought a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
