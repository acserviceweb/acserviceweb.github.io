The team took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We picked getting something more pricey than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our most significant utility expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
