<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals.

Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent.
