<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
