<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my companies, my own houses and my property customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. When I called and he encouraged me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again, he assisted me trouble shoot the issue. He is truthful, trustworthy, and affordable on rate. It's tough to discover an honest AC person and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>It may feel comfortable being sealed in tight versus the cold in your home throughout the chillier months of the year, but for people who are delicate to indoor irritants or have breathing problems, winter can worsen problems.

In late winter and early spring, it may still be too chilly to throw open the windows to take out the moldy air, so while you wait for the warmer weather it is very important to be aware of a few of the allergy and breathing triggers that might be prowling in your environments.<p>
