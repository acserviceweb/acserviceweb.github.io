<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ may notice moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>
<p>As discussed above, activating your new under tile flooring heating unit too soon, before the mortar has actually cured, can trigger the grout to break or to not adhere properly, and may void the service warranty of your mortar item. In some testing, even the tile broken when the system was run prior to the substance had actually cured. And mortar makers might refuse warranty coverage if you do not follow their directions.<p>
