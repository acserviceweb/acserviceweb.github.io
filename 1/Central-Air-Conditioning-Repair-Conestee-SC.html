<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the tools or abilities required to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and proper air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the needed equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still required to have an expert technician check the system occasionally.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as crucial when it comes to central air costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, however will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not have the ability to correctly cool the house on hot days. Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
