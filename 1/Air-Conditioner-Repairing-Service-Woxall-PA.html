<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the see. They advised changing a few parts that were going out.

I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was very pleased they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will certainly be utilizing them once again.<p>

Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
