<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from procedures or items; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is often crucial to determining the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such info can in some cases be obtained by requesting copies of air monitoring information from the company. If monitoring information is not readily available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have been reported, the Union agent ought to ask for that the employer have air tracking tests conducted. Review of this data might determine possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are very low, monitoring information may not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
