<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by improving air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, determined particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Because pesticides can be found far from the site of their initial application, it is sensible to decrease the use of chemical pesticides outdoors as well as indoors.

Termite damage can be minimized or avoided by ensuring that wooden building products do not enter direct contact with the soil and by saving fire wood away from the house. By appropriately fertilizing, watering, and aerating yards, the requirement for chemical pesticide treatments of lawns can be considerably decreased.<p>

<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices normally lasts years, since it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to set up.

In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>

And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
