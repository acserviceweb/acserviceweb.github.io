<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets ask for assessment and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
