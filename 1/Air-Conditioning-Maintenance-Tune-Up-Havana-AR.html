<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the flooring level.

When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was very practical in gathering info on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and offered clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
