That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a possibility to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In reality, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
