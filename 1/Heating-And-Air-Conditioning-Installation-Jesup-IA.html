<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC system than a smaller home, which will affect installation costs. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other factors that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Reality: Federal and local incentives usually amount to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the preliminary price of a system competitive with traditional devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, throughout new building and construction (houses usually utilize in between one and 5 tons). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. However, new installation practices are decreasing costs, to the point where the cost is getting closer to standard systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
