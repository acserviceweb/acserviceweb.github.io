<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run because it has to run longer than a properly sized system. Because it merely takes more electrical power to run a larger system, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate. And an oversize system does not lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a chance to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>
