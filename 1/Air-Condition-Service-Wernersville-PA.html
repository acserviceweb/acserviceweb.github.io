<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
