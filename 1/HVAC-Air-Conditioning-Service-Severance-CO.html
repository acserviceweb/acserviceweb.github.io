<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended guarantees or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
