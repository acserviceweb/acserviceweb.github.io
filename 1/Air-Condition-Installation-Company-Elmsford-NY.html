<p>Reinstall the access panel and detach block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait on the AC to start (see Be Client at Startup," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan should spin. If the compressor starts but the fan doesn't, the fan motor is most likely shot. Shut off the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then see and repower the unit if the fan starts. If  it does not, you've offered it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
