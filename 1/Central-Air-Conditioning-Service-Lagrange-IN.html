<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives requests for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, many of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan.

<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and people; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these contaminants through the home.<p>
