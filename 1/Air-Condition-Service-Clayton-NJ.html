<p>A/c can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
