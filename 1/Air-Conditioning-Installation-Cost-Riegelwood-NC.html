<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
