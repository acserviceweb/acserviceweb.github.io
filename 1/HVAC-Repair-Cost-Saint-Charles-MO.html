<p>IAQ can be affected by gases (consisting of carbon monoxide, radon, unstable natural compounds ), particulates, microbial pollutants (mold, bacteria ), or any mass or energy stressor that can induce unfavorable health conditions.

During high use months, check the filters at least regular monthly.<p>

The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
