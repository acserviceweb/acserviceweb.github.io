<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Santa Clara UT Home Owners</h3>
<p>One of the primary factors a furnace will run continuously is because something is unclean or blocked Before trying to fix any issue, take some time to make certain that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". Check the furnace blower for clogging and clean it if the air filter is great to go. Have a look at the furnace blower motor and lube it if this does not work.

<p>Oil heaters tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which needs to be properly vented and cleaned from the furnace frequently. Modification the filters periodically and have your ductwork cleaned because the soot builds up inside the ducts, lowering their performance with time. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, typically set up on the roofing, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, however it is also an alternative for house owners to think about. Many times, these systems include not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost.
