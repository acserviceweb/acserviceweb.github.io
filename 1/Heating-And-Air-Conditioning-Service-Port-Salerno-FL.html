<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating equipment can last for years. However if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel expenses all of a sudden seem greater than regular, it is probably time to consider a brand-new system. New heating equipment is even more efficient-- you'll see lower fuel costs immediately, not to discuss the money you'll save money on repair costs. You can most likely expect to cut your fuel costs in half if your heating system is 25 years old or more.<p>
<p>If your central air conditioning conditioner will not cool but you can hear it running, it might just need to be cleaned.

The following are standards; constantly describe your owner's handbook. Note: Constantly turn off the power before cleaning the system.<p>

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor sensibly, many of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners.

While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a trustworthy company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
