Since it exhausts warm air out the top, do not place the condenser under a deck or entirely enclose it. Any air flow restriction will lower the system's efficiency. You can, nevertheless, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
<p>Employ professionals and treat them well: Motivated, well-compensated professionals carry out far better work than short-term subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success. Because they're inexpensive, an ethical company doesn't exploit inexpensive labor chances just. Economical craftsmanship is typically substandard workmanship, and it never helps a company construct long-term relationships with customers.<p>
