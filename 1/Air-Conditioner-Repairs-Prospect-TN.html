Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star advises replacing your filter once every 3 months. Throughout high usage months, check the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>

<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
