<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your ac system is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Just including refrigerant is not an option if it leaks. An experienced technician should repair any leak, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the proper quantity of refrigerant.
