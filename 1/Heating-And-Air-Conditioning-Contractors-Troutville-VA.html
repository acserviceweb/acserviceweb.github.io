<h3>Replacing Your Boiler in Troutville VA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was really clear and fast about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
