<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO protect the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor sensibly, a number of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a reliable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for seven years, even though it was 6 months before the current one ended. She didn't need a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
