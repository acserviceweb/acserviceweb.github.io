<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services at Bremen IN</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not use them.. Second of all like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to appropriately service and the system has actually been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
