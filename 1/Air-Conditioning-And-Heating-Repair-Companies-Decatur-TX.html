<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air toxins depends upon numerous factors consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether a person responds to a toxin depends on individual level of sensitivity, which varies tremendously from individual to person. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological or chemical pollutants after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heat pump, whatever requires to be replaced eventually. As devices ages, it ends up being less efficient.

<p>HVAC systems have moving pasts in compressor s, blood circulation units, and furnaces. These moving parts need to be lubricated routinely to lessen friction and the resultant wear and tear.

This procedure needs to be duplicated often to secure the HVAC system from excessive damage.<p>
<p>Our indoor air quality experts can convert your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center.
