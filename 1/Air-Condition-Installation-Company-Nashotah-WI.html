<h3>Ventilation System in Nashotah Wisconsin</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely helpful in gathering information on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to temporarily cope with the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, the majority of typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately put or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which might enter nearby ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
