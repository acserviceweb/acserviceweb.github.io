<p>AC systems and thermostats have integrated hold-up features when they're shut down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the system doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>I am really amazed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years ago and understand the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
