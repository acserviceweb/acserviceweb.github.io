<p>I'll begin with a natural gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your house via ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly uncomplicated procedure.
