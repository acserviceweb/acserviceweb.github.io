These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or washed as conditions call for.

Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as building materials, furnishings, and household items like air fresheners, release contaminants more or less constantly.

High toxin concentrations can remain in the air for extended periods after a few of these activities.<p>
