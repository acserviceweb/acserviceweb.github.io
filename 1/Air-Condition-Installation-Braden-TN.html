<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source.

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a reference in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
