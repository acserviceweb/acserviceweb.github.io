<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
