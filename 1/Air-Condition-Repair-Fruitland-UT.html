Running on electricity, a heat pump is an affordable service using a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, but in reverse.

<p>Because it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll start with a natural gas furnace.

Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a relatively simple process. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite pricey.<p>
