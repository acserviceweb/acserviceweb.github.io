<p>A/c can create a great deal of water due to the fact that they get rid of moisture from the air. To eliminate this, they have an usually plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To deal with condensate problems, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
