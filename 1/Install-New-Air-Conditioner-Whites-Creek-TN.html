Forced air heating unit tend to struggle with things like duct leakages, which rob them of approximately 30% of their output.

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep. Leaking return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a reference later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
