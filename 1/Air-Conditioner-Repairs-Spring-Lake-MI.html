<p>Reinstall the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Client at Startup," below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan should spin. If the compressor begins however the fan doesn't, the fan motor is more than likely shot. Shut down the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan starts.
