<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
