This action is necessary so the system isn't too large-both or too small waste energy.<p>
<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, considering that a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
