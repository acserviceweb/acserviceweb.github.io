<p>First, in terms of benefits, heating the whole house or structure from one system makes things easier logistically, and the isolation of the heating system from the living space is a reward for some house owners. The system can be utilized to supply hot water in addition to climate control. Additionally, homeowners can adjust temperatures in different parts of the house by closing vents in ductwork or by using space or area-specific temperature controls. You can also set a schedule with central heating systems. In general, central heating provides a decreased ecological impact.<p>
<p>There is a required balance in making your decision though as systems with higher AFUE rankings often include greater cost. So, make sure to decide based on how often you will use your heating unit, the load that will be put on it and the frequency with which you plan on having it serviced each year. For most temperate climates with low heating loads in the winter, having an incredibly high ranked heater is not constantly essential.<p>
