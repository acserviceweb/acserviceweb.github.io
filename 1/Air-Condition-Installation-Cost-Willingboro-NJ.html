<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the prospective to negatively impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and very little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should evaluate and, if needed, update the structure envelope. For instance, he might seal spaces and cracks in the external walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs. Insulation may be a more reliable service to your cooling problems than changing your equipment.<p>
<p>The lifespan of a central air conditioning unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's a/c unit are more energy efficient than models made 5 years ago, so it makes monetary sense to change or upgrade your system if it's 5 years old or older.

<p>Fact: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that exact same aquifer.

In the summer months, the procedure reverses, consequently cooling a home by removing heat. Underground temperature remains constant no matter the environment, so geothermal systems provide constant and reputable cooling and heating.<p>
