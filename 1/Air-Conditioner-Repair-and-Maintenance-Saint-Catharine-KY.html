<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside system as near to your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Utilized together with other types of heating or cooling, such as portable or window a/c unit, area heaters, or oil heaters, it can boost the comfort of your home while keeping your monthly energy expense reasonable.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
