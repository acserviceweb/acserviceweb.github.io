<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
