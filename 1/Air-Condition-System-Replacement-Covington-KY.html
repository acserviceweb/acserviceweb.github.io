<p>There is no simple answer, however many utilize the general rule that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is probably a better solution.

<p>Over the past few years, there has been some promotion suggesting that houseplants have been revealed to minimize levels of some chemicals in lab experiments. There is currently no evidence, however, that a sensible number of houseplants get rid of substantial quantities of contaminants in houses and offices.
