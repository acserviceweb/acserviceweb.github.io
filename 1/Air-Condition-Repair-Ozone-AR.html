<h3>Ventilation Systems in Ozone AR</h3>
<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to decrease the amount of energy required for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions must also be required to decrease contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, citizens need to be alert to the development of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Additional weatherization steps should not be undertaken up until these issues have actually been fixed.<p>
<p>Before you go out and purchase an ac system, there are a couple of things to choose initially. Where are you going to be setting up the a/c? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioner be? Too large and you'll face problems with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning system and reduce its life. Too little and your ac system will not have the ability to cool the house effectively. These are just a few of the elements that you require to take into account when buying a brand-new AC system. Each option can and will considerably affect your system's performance, which is why you can't afford to neglect any of them.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, however many utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is probably a better option. If the existing system has not incurred other significant repairs, is in otherwise outstanding condition, and issues that resulted in the breakdown can be determined and treated, repairing the system can make a lot of sense as well.<p>
