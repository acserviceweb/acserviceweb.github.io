<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Conklin MI</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was quick and extremely clear about his evaluation, guaranteeing I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
