<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Installation in Starr South Carolina</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c into a heat pump While room cooling offers optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of spaces at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
