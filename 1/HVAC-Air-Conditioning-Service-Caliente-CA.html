<p>If no contaminant sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists. Extreme re-circulation of air results in "stale air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. Stale air might also be an issue when ventilation is not adequate to account for a boost in the number of workers in the location.<p>
<p>Some health results may show up soon after a single exposure or duplicated exposures to a toxin. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue.

Soon after exposure to some indoor air pollutants, symptoms of some diseases such as asthma might show up, be aggravated or aggravated.<p>

<p>They were excellent! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially requested. They satisfied my requirements totally by supplying an expert quote with options, without pushing additional items.

Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
