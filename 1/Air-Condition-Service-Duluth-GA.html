<p>A/c can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
