<p>Co2 (CO2) is a relatively simple to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants discharged by human beings, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are uncommonly high indoors may cause occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the main indoor source of co2 in many structures.
