<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>

<p>Central air conditioners, frequently described as central air conditioning" or split-system air conditioning", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the floorings, ceilings, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
