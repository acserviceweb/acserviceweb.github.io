<p>Devices expenses are driven by the type of furnace at the heart of your home heating system. Low-efficiency designs will cost less, however result in greater energy bills. High-efficiency models cost more, however conserve more over the long haul. Rates for gas furnaces range from $1,360 for the low-efficiency designs approximately $12,500 for high-efficiency models.

<p>Next, and maybe simply as important when it comes to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not be able to properly cool the house on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air system requires to hold.<p>

The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to individual bed rooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
