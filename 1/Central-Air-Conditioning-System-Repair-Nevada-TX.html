<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have a problem as long as your home still heats to the best temperature level. The temperature level of the air produced by the heatpump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel extremely hot. If your home is not heating up, only be concerned. Nevertheless, if your system does not seem working appropriately, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you should call in a professional to repair the system and check.<p>
