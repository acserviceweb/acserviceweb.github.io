Insufficient ventilation also occurs if the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or placed in such a method that outside air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Incorrectly situated outdoor air intake vents can likewise generate air contaminated with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms.
