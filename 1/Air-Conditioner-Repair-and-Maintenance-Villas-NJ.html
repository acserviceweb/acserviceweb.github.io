<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Villas New Jersey</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>As you typically require to use a self-leveling compound on top of the electric underfloor heating system, you should consider the time it takes for this to totally dry before the flooring covering can be put in place - this is normally a day or two.
