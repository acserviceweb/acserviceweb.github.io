<p>Expert heater installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will eventually fail. HVAC specialists recommend following this fundamental guideline when deciding whether it's worth buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost majority the rate of a brand-new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than necessary.<p>
