<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very practical in collecting info on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to temporarily cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and offered clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and home.<p>

Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to suffice till you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
