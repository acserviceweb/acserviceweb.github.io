Just like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling impact. A lot of ground source heatpump have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this implies is that for each unit of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, roughly 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the kind of heat.<p>
