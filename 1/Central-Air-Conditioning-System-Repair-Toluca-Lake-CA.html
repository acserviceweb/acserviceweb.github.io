<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c works but your house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
