<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, wall, floor, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 2 days might end up being a source for mold growth and need to be disposed of. Sometimes there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can flourish in hidden or seldom accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the wetness problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the location utilizing established health department suggestions.<p>
