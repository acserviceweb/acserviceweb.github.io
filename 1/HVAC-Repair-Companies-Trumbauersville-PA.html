<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical product over time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
