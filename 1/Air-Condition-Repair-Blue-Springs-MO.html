<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating equipment can last for many years.

<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were popular in the first half of the 20th century, particularly in commercial buildings, apartment and very large residences.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
