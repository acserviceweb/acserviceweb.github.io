<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat.

We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product with time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
