<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everybody can afford, a lot of Seattleites should find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service.
