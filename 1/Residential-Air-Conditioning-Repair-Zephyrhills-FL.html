<p>I'll start with a natural gas furnace because it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for performance. Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a relatively straightforward process.

<p>People have actually been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint due to the fact that these activities create large amounts of lead dust.

<p>You might upgrade to the highest effectiveness equipment readily available and still not feel easily cool on hot days.
