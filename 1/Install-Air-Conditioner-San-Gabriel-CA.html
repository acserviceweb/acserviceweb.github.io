So, when you call Sound Heating, you know that you'll get someone who not only knows what you require however who comprehends the really real world concerns you have in regards to your energy use, heating capacity, and the convenience of your household.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not use them.  Secondly like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the system has been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
