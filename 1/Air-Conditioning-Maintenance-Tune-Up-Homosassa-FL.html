By setting up dehumidification devices inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy some of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without replacing any equipment.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
