<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable.
