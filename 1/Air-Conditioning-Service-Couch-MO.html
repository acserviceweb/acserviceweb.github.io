<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace professionals often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>There are many things to consider when trying to determine how typically I need to change my a/c filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has a special DNA on how it accumulates dust and dirt. It takes about six months of close observation to see how often your cooling filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better best decision on how frequently your HVAC filters need changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 houses have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less often you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with just one air conditioning filter require changing more often.<p>
