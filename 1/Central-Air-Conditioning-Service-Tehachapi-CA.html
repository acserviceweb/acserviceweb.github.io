<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>In a split-system central air conditioning conditioner, an outside metal cabinet consists of the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet contains the evaporator. In many split-system air conditioners, this indoor cabinet also consists of a furnace or the indoor part of a heat pump. The ac system's evaporator coil is installed in the cabinet or main supply duct of this furnace or heatpump. If your home already has a furnace but no air conditioner, a split-system is the most cost-effective central air conditioning conditioner to install.<p>
