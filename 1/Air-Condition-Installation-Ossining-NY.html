<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Since heating and cooling work may also require repairing or setting up pipes to provide oil or gas to heating devices, an HVAC contractor may also be required to hold a separate plumber's license or have a certified plumbing on call.

When getting an estimate, be sure to ask not just if a company is licensed, however also what type of license it holds.<p>
