Due to the fact that they don't need any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Because a system is set up in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>
