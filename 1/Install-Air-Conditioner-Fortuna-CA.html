<p>Radiant heat uses a variety of unique advantages over forced air heating systems. For example, radiant heat systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems. They do not need to worry about duct leaks, which are responsible for output losses of as much as 30% in other heating system types. Transmitting heat through solid things will also trigger it to last longer than using air as a thermal medium. A home heated up by a glowing system will warm up quicker, and stay warm with less energy spent. These are just a few of the numerous benefits that a radiant heat system can provide you.<p>

<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists if no pollutant sources are discovered. Excessive re-circulation of air results in "stale air" conditions. Stale air has greater levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. Stale air might also be an issue when ventilation is not sufficient to account for an increase in the number of employees in the location.<p>
<p>Oehl Heating, Electric, & A/c, Inc opened for service in 1949 to provide Amana, IA, and surrounding location house owners with quality plumbing, a/c, heating, and electrical services. Our owner, Michael J. Even, started with the company in 1983, which he then purchased in 1995. During this time, he's worked as the President for the Iowa chapter of the Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Contractors Association. Mike is also enthusiastic about serving and supporting local communities and school programs.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works however the house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
