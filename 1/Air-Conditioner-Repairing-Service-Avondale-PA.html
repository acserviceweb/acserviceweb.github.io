<p>We take a look at ideas before we provide guidance to replace rather than repair a heater. Among the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are greater every year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It may be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be losing money by not changing the older unit.<p>
