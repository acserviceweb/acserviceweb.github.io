<h3>HVAC Services Near Me in Velva ND</h3>
<p>I have been using them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my real estate customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again. He is truthful, reliable, and sensible on cost. It's tough to discover a sincere AC man and I'm happy I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and people; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Contaminated central air handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
