<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single household homes, apartment, hotels and senior living centers, medium to big commercial and office complex such as skyscrapers and health centers, lorries such as vehicles, trains, submarines, ships and aircrafts, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are controlled with regard to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is taken in from inside and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, human beings breathe out co2, which in little amounts is not poisonous, however may end up being dangerous if high concentrations are permitted to build up. Micro-organisms or germs may also exist within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they might spread throughout the whole office or building by means of the ventilation system.<p>
