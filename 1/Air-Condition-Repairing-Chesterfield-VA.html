<p>The federal government advises that houses be weatherized in order to minimize the amount of energy needed for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, steps must also be taken to minimize pollution from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, locals should look out to the development of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization procedures should not be carried out up until these problems have been remedied.<p>
