As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

<h3>AC Maintenance in New Palestine IN</h3>
<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally caused by the lack of sufficient ventilation, which results in a buildup of pollutants from sources in the home.
