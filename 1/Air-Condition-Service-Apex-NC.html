<h3>HVAC Repair Warnings You Should Not Ignore Apex NC</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the math lately, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine assessments. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
