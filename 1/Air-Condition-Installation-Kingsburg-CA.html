<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.

Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers relatively.

<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ might discover moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse, talk with your doctor about them. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for great structure management.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by individuals and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become airborne. Infected central air handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
