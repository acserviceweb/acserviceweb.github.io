<h3>Designing Tips to Central Heating Systems at Saint Michael MN</h3>

Just like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE rates how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling result. Most ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every single unit of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the type of heat.<p>
