<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a referral later on). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
