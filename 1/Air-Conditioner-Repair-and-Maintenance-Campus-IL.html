<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use car debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
