<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it needs to run longer than a correctly sized system. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate due to the fact that it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a chance to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In fact, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
