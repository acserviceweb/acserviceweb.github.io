<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For New Market TN Home Owners</h3>
<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even little window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>

That's the last thing you want because you will need to hunt for alternative heating sources till the system is repaired.
