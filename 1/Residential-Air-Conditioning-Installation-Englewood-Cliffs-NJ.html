<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most inexpensive. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>An automobile's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes old and dirty.

A coolant flush is fundamental maintenance for your vehicle's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Auto Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>
