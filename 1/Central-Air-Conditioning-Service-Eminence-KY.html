Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
