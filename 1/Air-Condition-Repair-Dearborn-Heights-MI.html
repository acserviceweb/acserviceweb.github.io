<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Dearborn Heights MI</h3>
<p>For whole house setups, it's challenging, if almost difficult, to retrofit a radiant heat system in an existing house, particularly a hydronic system. Localized glowing floor heat systems to be used in one or several spaces like restrooms, kitchens or laundry rooms are quickly refurbished with electric glowing floor heat. This is a lot more cost-effective on a smaller sized scale. Bigger renovations like additions to a house may appropriate for a larger scale and more pricey hydronic system.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
