Not only was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
