<p>Scott Hauncher, a partner at Huron Capital, said Pueblo tries to find more than simply additional revenue or scale when it makes acquisitions - it looks for companies that can expand Pueblo's customer base or provide a new line of services. For example, prior to the Niemeyer acquisition, Pueblo carried out restricted plumbing work for choose customers. With this acquisition, Pueblo broadened its capabilities, making it possible for an improved worth proposition for a more comprehensive set of clients.<p>

A voided service warranty won't do you any good should the system fail or breakdown. Do it right from the beginning and hire a certified individual with the experience to install the system.<p>
