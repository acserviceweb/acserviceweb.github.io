<p>Similar to a lot of house enhancement projects, the cost of a complete central heater can vary widely based on the size of the house. Most furnaces will last in between 15 and twenty years. In picking a furnace, property owners should consider heat output and performance. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the house. A small house, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too rapidly and shut off for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>
