<h3>Heat Pump Cost in West Harrison NY</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for years for my organisations, my own homes and my property customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is honest, dependable, and reasonable on cost. It's difficult to find an honest AC person and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
