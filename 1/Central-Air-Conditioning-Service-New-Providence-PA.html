<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>There is a needed balance in making your choice though as systems with higher AFUE rankings often feature higher price tags.
