<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<p>I generally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
