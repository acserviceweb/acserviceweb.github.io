<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more troubles, considering that some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>
