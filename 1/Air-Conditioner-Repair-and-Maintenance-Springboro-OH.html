<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in.
