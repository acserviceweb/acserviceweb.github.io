<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, as opposed to outdoor or industrial settings. In tasks where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It might also consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to individual areas.<p>
