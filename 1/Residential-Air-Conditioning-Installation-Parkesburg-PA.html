<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical product over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
