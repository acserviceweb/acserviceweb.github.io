Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.

But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>

I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
