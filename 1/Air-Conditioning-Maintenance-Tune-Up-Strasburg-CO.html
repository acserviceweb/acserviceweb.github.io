<h3>Gas Central Heating in Strasburg CO</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
