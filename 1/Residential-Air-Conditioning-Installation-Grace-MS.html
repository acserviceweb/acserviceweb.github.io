<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged.

The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
