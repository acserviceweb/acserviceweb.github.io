My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them..

Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
