<p>The function of a lot of building ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for resident convenience while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building safety at reasonable energy costs. Load calculating is referred to as the Handbook J computation and must be performed by the HVAC contractor before giving an installation or system cost for cooling.
