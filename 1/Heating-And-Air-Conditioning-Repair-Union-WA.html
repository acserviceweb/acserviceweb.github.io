<h3>Signs You Might Need an AC Repair Service at Union WA</h3>

<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
