<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the see. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was very delighted they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will absolutely be using them once again.<p>
