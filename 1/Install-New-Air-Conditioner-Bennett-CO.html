I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was very delighted they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will absolutely be using them once again.<p>
