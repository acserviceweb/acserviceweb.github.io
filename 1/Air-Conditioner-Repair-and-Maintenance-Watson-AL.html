<p>Discover PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects contaminants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage performance rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A really efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-lasting performance of any air cleaner depends on preserving it according to the producer's instructions.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Photo 6).<p>
