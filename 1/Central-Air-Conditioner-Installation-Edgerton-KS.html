<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- give All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work very well in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Working on electrical power, a heat pump is an economical solution using a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, however in reverse. Rather of warming or cooling the air already inside your home, it draws heat or cool from the air exterior and presses it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>All heating systems have some level of air purification. From the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all require some standard maintenance.

<p>Oil heating systems are generally not extremely efficient. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, but the majority of do not achieve a performance higher than 90%.
