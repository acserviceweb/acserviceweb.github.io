<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was kind of unusual being that package was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The product was incredibly lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets.

<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioner into a heatpump While space air conditioning provides maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is normally more expensive than central air.<p>
