<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your Montclair NJ Home</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on numerous home effectiveness upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to help us discuss which upgrades were cost reliable, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest savings. We never felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's services and products was impressive. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a sensible level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to carry out the essential electrical enhancements to minimize cost.<p>
<p>Old furnaces frequently lack the capability to hydrate and clean the air in your home. Your home air may feel stagnant or stuffy. Does anyone in your family experience allergic reactions to air-borne dust, mold, pollen, infections or dander? Or does anyone suffer from dry nose, dry throat, or dry skin? Other indications may be frequent dust accumulation, static shocks, drooping plants, furniture cracking and musical instruments that do not remain in tune. These may seem like rather ridiculous and insignificant observations but all recommend that your old furnace is not efficient in providing you with the convenience you and your family might desire and need. Poor indoor air quality might also not be associated with on old furnace, bad ventilation and other factors can trigger it, too. Please contact us to have one of our service technicians examine your circumstance as we might have other air quality services and solutions for you.<p>
