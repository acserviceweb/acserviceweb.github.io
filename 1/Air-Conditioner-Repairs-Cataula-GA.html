<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in Cataula GA</h3>
<p>Last week, Target told press reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the initial intrusion into its systems was traced back to network credentials that were taken from a third party supplier. Sources now tell KrebsOnSecurity that the supplier in question was a heating, air and refrigeration  conditioning subcontractor that has operated at a number of areas at Target and other leading merchants.<p>
<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity professional at a large retailer who asked not to be called because he did not have approval to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a group that routinely keeps an eye on energy usage and temperatures in stores to minimize costs (especially during the night) and to alert shop supervisors if temperature levels in the stores change outside of an acceptable variety that could avoid consumers from shopping at the store.<p>

There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
