It sounds amazing, but furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>Similar to most house enhancement tasks, the cost of a complete central heating unit can vary extensively based upon the size of the house. The majority of furnaces will last between 15 and twenty years. In picking a furnace, property owners need to think about heat output and efficiency. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home. A little house, for example, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too rapidly and turn off for too long, leading to irregular temperature levels.<p>
