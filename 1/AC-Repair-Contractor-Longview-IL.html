For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 need to be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be essential.<p>
