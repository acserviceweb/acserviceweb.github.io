<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. The likelihood of immediate responses to indoor air pollutants depends on several aspects consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions. Sometimes, whether a person responds to a pollutant depends on individual level of sensitivity, which varies significantly from person to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological or chemical toxins after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by dispersing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>
