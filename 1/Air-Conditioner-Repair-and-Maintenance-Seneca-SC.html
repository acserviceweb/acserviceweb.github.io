This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the a/c unit into a heat pump While room air conditioning offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is generally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
