Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace too.

It is most likely that it is supported by the plumbing if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. If the tank or heat exchanger ever require to be changed, install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have actually to be cut.<p>

Adoption of these technologies, nevertheless, has not been widespread, as consumers remain mostly oblivious to the results of air quality on health and efficiency.<p>
<p>If the AC does not turn off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't emit heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can take place with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick up until you buy a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
