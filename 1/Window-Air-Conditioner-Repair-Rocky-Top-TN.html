<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Rocky Top TN</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very delighted that someone as skilled as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c unit before you buy.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
