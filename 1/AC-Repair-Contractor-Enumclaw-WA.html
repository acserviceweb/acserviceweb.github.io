<p>The first air conditioners and fridges employed poisonous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might lead to deadly mishaps when they leaked.

The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
