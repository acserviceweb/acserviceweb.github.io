This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
