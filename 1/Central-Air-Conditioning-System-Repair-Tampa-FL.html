<p>Chemical toxins: Volatile natural compounds ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are many, differed, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally taking place chemical compounds. Chemical toxins can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products used in the building (e.g., workplace equipment; furnishings, wall and flooring coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer items) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>

<p>Next, and maybe just as important when it comes to central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to correctly cool the house on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
