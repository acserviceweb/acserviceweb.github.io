<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heaters are still widely used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
