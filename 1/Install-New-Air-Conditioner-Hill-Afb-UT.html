<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not offer them.  Second of all like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat clients relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the system has actually been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
