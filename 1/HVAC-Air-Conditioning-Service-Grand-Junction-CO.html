<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly unusual now.

<p>Energy performance can be enhanced even more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating unit.

<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have two different units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While space a/c offers maximum versatility, when utilized to cool numerous rooms at a time it is usually more pricey than central air.<p>
