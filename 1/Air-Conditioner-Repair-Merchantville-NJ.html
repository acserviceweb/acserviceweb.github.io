Throughout the summertime and winter seasons, central air conditioning systems and furnaces supply adequate cooling and heating power to homes in Redmond. The average daytime temperature highs range from the low to upper-70s during June, July, and August, and when heat waves pass through the neighborhood, temperature levels will rise to the mid-80s.

Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct.
