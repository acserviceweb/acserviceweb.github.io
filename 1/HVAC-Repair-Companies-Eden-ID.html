<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently greater incomes for air conditioning tradespersons. This might be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable climate, or merely a high level of competition for knowledgeable trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's greatest average earnings for HVAC service technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 each year. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year.

<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not offer off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen gradually because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work until you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they give me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
