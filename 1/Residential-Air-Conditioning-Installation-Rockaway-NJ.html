The style expert must consult ASHRAE data for the standards of style and care as the typical building regulations offer little to no details on HVAC design practices; codes such as the UMC and IMC do include much information on installation requirements, however. Other helpful reference products include items from SMACNA, ACGIH, and technical trade journals.<p>
