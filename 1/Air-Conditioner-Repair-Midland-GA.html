Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits.

<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature level, and after that switch it ON.

You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
