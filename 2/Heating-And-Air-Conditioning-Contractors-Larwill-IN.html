<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Larwill IN</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
