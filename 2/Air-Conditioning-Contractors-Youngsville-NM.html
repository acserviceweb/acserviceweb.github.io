<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heater, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>
