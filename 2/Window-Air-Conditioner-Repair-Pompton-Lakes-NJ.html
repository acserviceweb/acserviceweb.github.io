<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. Try a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>

<p>The predominant health effect related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your risk of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
