<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC system is frosty, the evaporator coil is most likely frozen.

Air pressure differences produced by these forces move airborne pollutants from locations of greater pressure to areas of lower pressure through any readily available opening in building walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move up until the within pressure is equal to the exterior.<p>
