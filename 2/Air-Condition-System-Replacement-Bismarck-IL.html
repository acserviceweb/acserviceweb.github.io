<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
