<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Parks AR</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Though it may be hard to believe, the air inside your house can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are infamous for decreasing the air quality in your house, however there are lots of other contaminants that can not only dirty up the air, however cause other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and structure products contribute to bad air quality, and can likewise cause cancers. VOCs (unpredictable organic compounds) from paint and even from some kinds of carpets and upholstery products can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
<p>Think about a whole home dehumidifier if your single phase air conditioner isn't old enough to justify replacement. By installing dehumidification equipment inside an existing single stage system, you can take pleasure in some of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without replacing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, enhancing indoor air quality and enabling greater comfort at higher temperature levels.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
