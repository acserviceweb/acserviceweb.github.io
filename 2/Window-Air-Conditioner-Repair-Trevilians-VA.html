<p>Because they remove moisture from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a normally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To handle condensate issues, please see Air Conditioner Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
