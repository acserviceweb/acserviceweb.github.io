We had actually acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c unit before you buy. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to test AC units even in winter. We want we had understood him then.<p>
