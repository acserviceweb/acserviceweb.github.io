<p>Immediate discount rates on high-efficiency heat pump technologies are readily available to devices installers, applied at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Outstanding Customer Support! Climate Pro is reliable and really cared about us and our scenario. We got back one evening to a cold home. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came over that same night. Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could look for and purchase it the next early morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely happy to have a heated home again. What's most fantastic was that this all happened throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover someone to help us right before a holiday, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily advise this company to my good friends.<p>

<p>A geothermal heating unit is more dependable than alternatives, and is not impacted by any external elements, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For instance, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar energy depends on regular sunlight to work effectively. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the sun nor the wind, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a reputable and available source of energy.<p>
