<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your house will not warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>We're investing a lot more time inside your home, nowadays. While many individuals assume pollution is simply an outside problem, your house (and office) can also be polluted.

The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a huge effect on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, dizziness, queasiness-- right away, they can begin years after direct exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA).

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine components. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>
