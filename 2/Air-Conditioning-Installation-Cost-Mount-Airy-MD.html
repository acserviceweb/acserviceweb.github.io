<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor devices through codes, and after more powerful standards are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
