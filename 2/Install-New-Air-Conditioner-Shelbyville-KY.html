<p>If no contaminant sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists. Extreme re-circulation of air results in "stagnant air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. When ventilation is not adequate to account for an increase in the number of workers in the location, stale air may also be a problem.<p>

Thus, ensuring the air is of excellent quality is the employer's responsibility.<p>
