From one of the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some standard maintenance.

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was really valuable in gathering details on the phone and providing clear directions about how to momentarily deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and used clear interaction about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely utilize Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>

<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service contract attempts to upsell you every time they come to perform routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for seven years, even though it was six months prior to the existing one expired. She didn't require a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
