In many cases it is because of poor furnace style, but oftentimes, it's from disregard. Apotheosis Heating & Home Comfort Solutions Combustion Optimization & Safety Inspection of your furnace includes a System Analysis, which checks for debris on the burners, bad airflow, and a filthy filter or blower, with cleaning and adjusting of the above as needed. The Performance Check-Up (see previous response above) is likewise important to your furnace's life expectancy.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet.
