In many cases it is because of poor furnace style, but oftentimes, it's from disregard. Apotheosis Heating & Home Comfort Solutions Combustion Optimization & Safety Inspection of your furnace includes a System Analysis, which checks for debris on the burners, bad airflow, and a filthy filter or blower, with cleaning and adjusting of the above as needed.
