<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
