<h3>Ductwork Repair and Replacement in Ibapah Utah</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
