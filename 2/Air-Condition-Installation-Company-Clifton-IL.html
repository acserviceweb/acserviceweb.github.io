<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as important as a regular oil change in your car.
