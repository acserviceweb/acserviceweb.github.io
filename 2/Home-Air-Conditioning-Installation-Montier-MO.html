<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that protect your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent chance; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on unusual celebrations.<p>
