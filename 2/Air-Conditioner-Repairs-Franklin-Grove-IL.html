<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
