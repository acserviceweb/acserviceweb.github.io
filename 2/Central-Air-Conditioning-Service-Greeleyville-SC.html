<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden floor joist system, beneath the wooded subsurface and final floor finish. This is generally utilized in a 2nd or third-floor  area and makes the most of the flooring joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and additional thickness of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber radiant flooring heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging long trenches or deep holes to install the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll conserve money over the long term because of the lower energy costs. Likewise, a geothermal system tends to last about two times as long as conventional air-source units.
