<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>

These examinations may begin with written questionnaires and telephone consultations in which building detectives assess the history of resident symptoms and structure operation procedures. In many cases, these queries may quickly uncover the issue and on-site gos to are unnecessary.<p>
