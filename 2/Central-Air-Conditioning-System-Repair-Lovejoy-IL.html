<p>Sean was extremely handy. He is a very enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure applied to buy additional stuff. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no issues aside from the blower motor. The only reason he could not install the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run because it simply takes more electrical power to run a larger system. And an oversize system does not lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The outcome is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
