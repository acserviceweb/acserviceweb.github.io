They include hold-ups in physical and psychological development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems.

Despite the fact that you may think that clearing the space of all products that might ignite someday uses adequate safety, often other scrap such as lint and dust might gather inside the furnace which may cause a fire.
