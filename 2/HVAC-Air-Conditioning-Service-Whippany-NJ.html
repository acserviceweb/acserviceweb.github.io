<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power should not go beyond the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the same time, since the overall capability of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Put simply, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that some of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the overall power is not easy, because it considers not just the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>A SEER score represents Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER ranking of an unit is the cooling output at varying temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the exact same duration. Basically, SEER provides more information based upon how the EER performs in different temperatures. The higher the system's SEER rating, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
