<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either since of noticeable development or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>Some health impacts might show up shortly after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures to a contaminant. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate effects are treatable and typically short-term. In some cases the treatment is just getting rid of the person's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined.
