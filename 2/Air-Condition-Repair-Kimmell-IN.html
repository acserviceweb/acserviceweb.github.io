<p>I have been using them for many years for my businesses, my own houses and my real estate clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with various costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. When I called and he advised me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he assisted me difficulty shoot the issue. He is honest, reliable, and affordable on price. It's difficult to find a truthful AC man and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>A vehicle's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes unclean and old. The old coolant will adversely affect the system's performance. To ensure the system is working effectively, consider having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your car's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Car Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from inside and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
