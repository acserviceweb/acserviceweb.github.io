<h3>Ways To Get the Most out of Your HVAC System at Long Green MD</h3>
<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise homes bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has actually seen the single-family home installation organisation totally turn on its head the last few years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to as much as 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not just with beginners more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle house owners are finally giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
