<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
