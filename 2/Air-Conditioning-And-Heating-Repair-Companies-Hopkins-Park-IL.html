<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Hopkins Park Illinois</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Leaky return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
