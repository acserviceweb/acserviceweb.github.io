Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the detach block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the a/c service still doesn't work appropriately after you've cleaned the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs.
