<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heating systems have multiple control boards. The largest, or just one in some heating systems, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards collaborate the operation and control of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control panel need to be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
