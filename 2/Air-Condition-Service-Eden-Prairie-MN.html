<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in Eden Prairie MN</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or changing air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of wetness, smells, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of unpleasant smells and excessive moisture, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior structure air distributing, and avoids stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
