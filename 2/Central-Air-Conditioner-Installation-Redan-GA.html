<p>The primary factor homeowners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the quantity of services provided. The cost may not be rewarding if the system is brand-new and still under a manufacturer's guarantee. Any major repairs ought to be covered under the producer's warranty. However, some manufacturers require regular maintenance as a regard to the guarantee.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should temporarily change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
