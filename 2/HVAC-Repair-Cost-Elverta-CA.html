Usually this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners must strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping costs the very same in all other areas.<p>
