<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners must strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping costs the very same in all other areas.<p>
