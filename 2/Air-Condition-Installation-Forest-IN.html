<p>Next, and perhaps just as crucial when it pertains to central air costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too big will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air.

<p>Central air conditioners, typically described as central air" or split-system air conditioning", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, walls, or floorings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the a/c unit to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers.
