<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be serious. They consist of delays in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, babies, and kids are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups because lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the destructive impacts of lead. Children may have greater direct exposures given that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
