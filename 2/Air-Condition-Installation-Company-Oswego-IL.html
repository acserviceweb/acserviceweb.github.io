<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely handy in collecting information on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and used clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
