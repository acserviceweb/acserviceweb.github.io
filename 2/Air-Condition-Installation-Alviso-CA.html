This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable climate, or just a high level of competition for proficient trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's highest typical wages for HVAC service technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 per year. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.

At the same time, heat is soaked up from inside and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>

One quarter have never ever cleaned up or replaced their furnace filter. And nearly 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there.
