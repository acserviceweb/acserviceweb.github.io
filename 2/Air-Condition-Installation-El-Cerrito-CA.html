<h3>Factors to Consider When Looking for a Good AC Repair Company at El Cerrito CA</h3>
<p>Ductless a/c is, of course, ideal for houses without ducts, however is also a versatile option for a variety of other situations. Instead of pressing cool air through shafts in walls, attic and floor, ductless systems circulate air straight to specific rooms. Really cost-efficient, and energy-efficient, and supplying greater control over when and where the air goes in your home, All Points Heating can assist you select the best ductless air conditioning system for your needs.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
