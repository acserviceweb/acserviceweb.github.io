<h3>Choosing the Right HVAC System For The Job in Chanhassen MN</h3>
<p>In the last several years, a growing body of scientific proof has indicated that the air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously contaminated than the outside air in even the largest and most industrialized cities. Other research study shows that individuals invest around 90 percent of their time inside. Hence, for lots of people, the threats to health might be greater due to direct exposure to air contamination inside your home than outdoors.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
