<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature of the floor. All wiring for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is dry and unobstructed.<p>
<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals utilized in the building and construction or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops should be utilized with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems installed to get rid of items of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also create particulates and must be vented outside.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
