<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
