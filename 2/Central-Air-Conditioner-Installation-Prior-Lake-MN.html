<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ might see moldy or unpleasant odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>
