Many typical structure materials used before 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Normally, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the structure products are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure renovation. Since the fibers can be spread out into the air during the elimination process, removal of asbestos-containing products is not always optimal. A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing products is typically recommended rather.<p>
