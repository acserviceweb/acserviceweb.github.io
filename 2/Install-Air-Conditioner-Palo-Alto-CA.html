Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, really filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
