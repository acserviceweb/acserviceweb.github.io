Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your house through ducts, and cool air is gathered via cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively simple procedure. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather costly if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
