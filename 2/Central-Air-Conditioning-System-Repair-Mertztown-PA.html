<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home won't warm up.

Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage.
