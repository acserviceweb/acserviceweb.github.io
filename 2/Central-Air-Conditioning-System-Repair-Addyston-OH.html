HVAC experts advise following this standard rule when choosing whether it's worth buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost majority the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than essential.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost great however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
