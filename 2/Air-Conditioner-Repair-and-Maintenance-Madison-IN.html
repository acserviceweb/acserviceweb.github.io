<p>Today's house radiant heat systems take full advantage of infrared radiation. By far, the most typical source of a radiator in a house is the floor mass. Radiators can be locally situated in one area like a bathroom floor or be set up throughout the entire sub-surface of the home's floors. Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating units-- although ceiling radiators are usually used in commercial applications like storage facilities.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. Over time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
