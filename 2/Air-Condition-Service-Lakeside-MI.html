<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
