Extra weatherization procedures ought to not be carried out until these issues have been fixed.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.
