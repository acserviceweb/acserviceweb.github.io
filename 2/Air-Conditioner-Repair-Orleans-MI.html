<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally caused by the lack of sufficient ventilation, which results in a buildup of impurities from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health identified inadequate ventilation as the main issue in majority the office indoor air examinations it has performed. Examinations performed in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have discovered the exact same to be true. These examinations exposed that proper ventilation is necessary in keeping good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>. Before selecting the installation location of air conditioner, a number of primary elements need to be thought about. To start with, the direction of air circulation from the indoor systems need to not fall on the location of rest or work area. Secondly, there should not be any barriers on the way of the airflow that might avoid it from covering the area of the facilities as much as possible. The outside unit should likewise be located in an open area, otherwise the heat from the house will not be effectively released outside and the performance of the entire system will drop greatly. It is extremely a good idea to set up the a/c unit systems in quickly available locations, for further maintenance during operation.<p>
