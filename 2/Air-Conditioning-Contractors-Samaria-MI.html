<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. Connection concerns along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the efficiency of the system. Loose, malfunctioning or missing wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and disrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace includes checking the advised connections along with temperature and pressure gauges. Take time to examine these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are protected and tight.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned routinely, they can become obstructed with particles that can limit airflow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Filthy filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases cause the system to shut down completely. By contrast, replacing a furnace and examining filter can usually be carried out in simply a couple of minutes, often without any tools needed. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
