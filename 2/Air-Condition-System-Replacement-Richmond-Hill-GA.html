<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Richmond Hill GA</h3>
<p>Whether it's the middle of winter or summer, having a working HVAC system is important. At Lowe's, we have a variety of heating and cooling systems-- from heaters and heat pumps to window ac system and portable air conditioning unit Plus, we provide air conditioning installation and heating installation by licensed professional independent installers.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
