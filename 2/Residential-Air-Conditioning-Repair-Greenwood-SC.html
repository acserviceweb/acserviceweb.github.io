<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
