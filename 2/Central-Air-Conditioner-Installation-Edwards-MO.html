<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you need to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
