<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the see. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning.
