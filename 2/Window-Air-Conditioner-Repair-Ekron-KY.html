<p>Information offered in this security guide is based on current scientific and technical understanding of the concerns provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. The standards do not require you to alter your existing central air units, and replacement parts and services must still be readily available for your house's systems. The "life-span" of a central air conditioning conditioner has to do with 15 to 20 years. Manufacturers typically continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts available and honoring maintenance agreements after the new standard goes into result.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single check out, or you can register for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and a/c company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance sees each year, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and normally some other perks. Some companies use priority consultations to their maintenance plan members.<p>

<p>I have been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a difficult job that the workers sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps people working. When a sales guy pertains to your house he exists to offer, that is the only way he is paid. You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and must not "require" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I give you the options for your needs and you decide if you need it.<p>
