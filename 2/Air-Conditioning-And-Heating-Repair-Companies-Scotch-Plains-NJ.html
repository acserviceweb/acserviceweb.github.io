<p>Specific instant results resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is typically tough to identify if the signs are an outcome of exposure to indoor air pollution.

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix used in automobiles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12.

For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by numerous people.<p>
