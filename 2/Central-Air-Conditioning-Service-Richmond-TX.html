<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power needs to not exceed the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units higher than the outside capacity by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, since the overall capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outside system. Simply put, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that some of the spaces might not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not simple, given that it takes into consideration not just the small power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and banned using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems.

This implies that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
