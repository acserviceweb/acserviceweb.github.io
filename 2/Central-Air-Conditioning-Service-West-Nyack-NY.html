<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in West Nyack New York</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>

I can tell you that it is a difficult job that the employees sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps people working. When a sales male concerns your house he is there to offer, that is the only way he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and should not "need" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I provide you the choices for your needs and you decide if you require it.<p>

<p>Sean was really valuable. He is an extremely pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues besides the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
