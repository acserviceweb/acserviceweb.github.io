<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price great however Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<h3>HVAC Maintenance Near Me in Emerald Isle NC</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

So, be sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service strategy which normally consists of a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
