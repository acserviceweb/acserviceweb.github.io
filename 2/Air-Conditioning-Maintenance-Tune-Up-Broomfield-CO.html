<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming typical features of environmentally friendly houses as part of the growing green building motion. Green projects accounted for 20 percent of all newly built houses in the U.S. last year. By 2016, a Wall Street Journal post predicted that green housing will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the whole real estate market.<p>

<p>Air flow patterns in structure are figured out by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural effects. Atmospheric pressure differences created by these forces move airborne contaminants from areas of greater pressure to areas of lower pressure through any readily available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move up until the within pressure amounts to the outside.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as important as a regular oil modification in your car.
