<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace service technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a series of various heating unit, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>
