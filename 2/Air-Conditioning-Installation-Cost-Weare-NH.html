<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>To begin, it's a good idea to think about energy performance. By choosing a central AC unit that has as high of a performance rating as possible, you can reduce your carbon footprint and save cash in the long run. Efficiency rankings must be labeled with all systems. While effective systems may cost more, going with an Energy Star-rated device is a great method to enjoy extra comfort.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service contract tries to upsell you every time they pertain to perform routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for seven years, although it was 6 months prior to the existing one ended. She didn't require a air filtration system, however they talked her into it.<p>
