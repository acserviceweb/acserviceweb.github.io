<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Service in Bunker Hill</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, a number of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
