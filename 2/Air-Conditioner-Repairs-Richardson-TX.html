<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil.

Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
