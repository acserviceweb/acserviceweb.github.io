<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>
<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more problems, considering that some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
