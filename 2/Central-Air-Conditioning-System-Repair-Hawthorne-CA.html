<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
