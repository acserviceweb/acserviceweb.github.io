<h3>Heating And Cooling Near Me in Hookerton NC</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Producers guarantee would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Likewise they identified the issue and fixed very rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>I am very impressed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years earlier and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
