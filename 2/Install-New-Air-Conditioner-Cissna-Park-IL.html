<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide should be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be essential.<p>
