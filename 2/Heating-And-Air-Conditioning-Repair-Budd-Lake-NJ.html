<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, houses and offices matters, particularly since we spend most of our lives inside. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in exceptionally damp environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is extra-large, it might not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the a/c unit will need more energy to cool your home. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
