<p>Check these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>
