<p>The purpose of the majority of building ventilation systems is to bring in adequate fresh air for resident convenience while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and developing safety at reasonable energy expenses. Your furnace has many parts that can affect the health and wellness of you and your loved ones. Having a total check of your furnace will offer assurance that it is safe to operate. Apotheosis Heating & House Convenience Solutions Combustion Optimization & Security Inspection of your furnace includes a Health & Security Analysis, which inspects the heat exchanger (carbon monoxide gas leaks and contaminated breathing air), checks the pilot safety (explosion threat), checks the high limitation (fire threat) and consists of a visual inspection for other threats.

<p>For example, impurities may gather within the air diffusers and grills, introducing contaminants into the environment.
