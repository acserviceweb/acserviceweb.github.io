A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>

This can lead to the capacity for substantial health issue.<p>
