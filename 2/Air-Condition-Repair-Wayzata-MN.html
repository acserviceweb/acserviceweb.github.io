<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the standard hot water heater can be turned off totally.<p>
