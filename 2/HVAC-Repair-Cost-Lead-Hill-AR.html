<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and effectively, however to have 2 significant parts fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>To be sincere, few of the centers managers who utilize our indoor air quality monitoring service came to us because of that. Usually they were at first thinking about remotely keeping an eye on some other aspect of their buildings, such as energy use, in an effort to cut expenses. It wasn't till later, as they continued dealing with us, that they found out about and executed indoor air quality monitoring to supply a much healthier, more secure structure environment-- and to avoid the unfavorable consequences related to indoor air pollutants.<p>

<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
