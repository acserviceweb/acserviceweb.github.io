<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power ought to not exceed the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units higher than the outside capability by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, since the total capacity of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Basically, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces may not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not simple, since it takes into consideration not only the small power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
