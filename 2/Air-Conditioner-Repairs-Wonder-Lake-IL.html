<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
