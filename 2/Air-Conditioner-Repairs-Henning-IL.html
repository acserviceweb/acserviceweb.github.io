<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Henning IL?</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the entire day as they required to remove the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating unit. We decided on getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our biggest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a tube twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
