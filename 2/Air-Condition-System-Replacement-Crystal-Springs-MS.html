The existing trend in home construction is to lower air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofing systems, walls, and floorings. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air helps and dilutes indoor impurities exhaust them from the house.<p>

In either case, if you want to keep your furnace heating for many years to come, don't forget to keep it serviced and preserved regularly.<p>
