Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>

It is most likely that it is supported by the plumbing if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. Set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever require to be replaced.<p>
