<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ may observe undesirable or moldy smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are worsening, speak with your physician about them. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for excellent structure management.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung out fixing the issue, all the while discussing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working properly. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
