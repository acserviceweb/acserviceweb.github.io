I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
