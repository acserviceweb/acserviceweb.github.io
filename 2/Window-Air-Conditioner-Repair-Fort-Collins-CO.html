<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, rather than outside or commercial settings. In tasks where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

Let the unit cool down for about five minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limit switch might have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, situated in the compressor's access panel.<p>
