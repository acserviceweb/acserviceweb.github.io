<h3>Frequent Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Moreno Valley CA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating unit. We selected getting something more expensive than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
