We left setting up the brand-new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the exact same. When the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately treat and harden-- typically two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
