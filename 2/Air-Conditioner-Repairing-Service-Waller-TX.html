<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Since it tires warm air out the top, do not place the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it. Any airflow limitation will reduce the system's effectiveness. You can, nevertheless, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
<p>We take a look at ideas before we offer suggestions to replace rather than repair a heating unit. Among the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are higher year after year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting cash by not changing the older system.<p>
