<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper.

When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
