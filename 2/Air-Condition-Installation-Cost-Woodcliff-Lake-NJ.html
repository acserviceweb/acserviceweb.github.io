<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of impurities that have the potential to negatively impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, germs, and very little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should evaluate and, if essential, upgrade the structure envelope. For instance, he may seal spaces and fractures in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs. Insulation may be a more reliable solution to your cooling issues than replacing your devices.<p>
<p>More common in relatively older houses, a boiler-based heating system uses oil, electrical power or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in individual spaces. All-electric boilers can accomplish as much as 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers must attain 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers must achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
