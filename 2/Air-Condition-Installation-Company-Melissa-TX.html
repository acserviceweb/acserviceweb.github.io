<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Equipment costs are driven by the kind of furnace at the heart of your house heating unit. Low-efficiency models will cost less, however result in greater energy costs.
