<p>Today, countless allergen, dead skin cells, construction particles, and mold may be living in your home's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe in addition to the effectiveness of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current survey by the Customer Reports National Proving Ground. However many of the things people do-- or don't do-- can contribute to the stew of airborne impurities in their homes and aggravate asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
