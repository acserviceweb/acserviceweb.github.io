<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company.

You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and ought to not "require" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I give you the choices for your requirements and you decide if you require it.<p>
