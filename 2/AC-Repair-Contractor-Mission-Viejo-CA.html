<p>Sean was extremely practical. He is a really enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems aside from the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
