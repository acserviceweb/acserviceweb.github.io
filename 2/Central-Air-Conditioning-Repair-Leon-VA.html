<h3>Get Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Leon VA</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present pattern in house building is to reduce air leak through cracks and other openings in floors, walls, and roofings. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the home.<p>
