<p>The federal government recommends that houses be weatherized in order to lower the amount of energy required for cooling and heating.

The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be inhaled.

While an area heating unit remains in use, open a door from the space where the heating unit lies to the rest of the home and open a window slightly.<p>
