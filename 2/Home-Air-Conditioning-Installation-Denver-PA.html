<p>Individuals operating in structures with poor IAQ may observe moldy or undesirable odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are worsening, speak with your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for excellent structure management.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the production of an aerosol result, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may go into neighboring ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outside water fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
