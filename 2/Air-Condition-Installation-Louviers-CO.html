<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, typically described as central air" or split-system air conditioning", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, walls, or floorings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the ac system to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
