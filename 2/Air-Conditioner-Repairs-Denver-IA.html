<h3>AC Replacement Service in Denver Iowa</h3>

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it could suck up to two times the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would use.

Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling bills than devices set up simply a few years ago.<p>
