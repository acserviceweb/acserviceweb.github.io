<p>Generally the most reliable way to enhance indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is likewise a more affordable approach to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later in this area.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
