<p>Sean was really helpful. He is a really enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure used to buy additional things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems aside from the blower motor.

<h3>Furnace Repair Near Me in Jackson MS</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my companies, my own houses and my realty clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He assisted me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again. He is truthful, trusted, and sensible on price. It's hard to find a truthful AC guy and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
