<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Many AC systems include a number of special functions that can even more enhance efficiency and efficiency. For instance, property owners might want to search for one that includes an integrated filter light that will signal you when the air filter needs to be changed.
