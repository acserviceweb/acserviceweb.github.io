That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down prior to it has a possibility to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>

<p>The primary health result related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
