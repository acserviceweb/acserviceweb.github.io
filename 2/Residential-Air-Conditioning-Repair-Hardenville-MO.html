He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing.

No additional charge.<p>
