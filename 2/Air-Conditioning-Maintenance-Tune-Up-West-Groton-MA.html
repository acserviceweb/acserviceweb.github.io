<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<h3>Ductwork Repair and Replacement in West Groton MA</h3>
<p>Poor indoor air quality is generally triggered by the absence of sufficient ventilation, which results in an accumulation of impurities from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recognized insufficient ventilation as the main problem in over half the office indoor air investigations it has conducted. Investigations carried out in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually discovered the very same to be true. These investigations revealed that correct ventilation is important in preserving good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The probability of instant responses to indoor air pollutants depends upon several elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two crucial impacts. In other cases, whether a person responds to a pollutant depends on individual level of sensitivity, which differs significantly from person to person. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological pollutants after duplicated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical pollutants too.<p>

<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by animals and individuals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. It can become airborne when it dries. Polluted central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
