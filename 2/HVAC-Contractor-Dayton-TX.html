<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not offer them.  Second of all like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to appropriately service and the unit has been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
