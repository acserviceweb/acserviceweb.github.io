The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their overall power must not surpass the capacity of the outside system. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units higher than the outside capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, because the overall capability of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outside unit. Basically, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that a few of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the estimation of the overall power is not easy, since it takes into account not just the small power of the systems, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set stronger indoor guidelines based on the most current science for NO2.

<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off contaminants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
