<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Companies in Satsuma</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

At present, not much is understood about what health impacts occur from the levels of organics typically discovered in houses. Many organic substances are known to trigger cancer in animals; some are thought of causing, or are known to cause, cancer in humans.<p>
