<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
