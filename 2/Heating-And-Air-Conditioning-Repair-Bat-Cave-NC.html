Further research study is required to better understand which health impacts occur after exposure to the average contaminant concentrations found in homes and which happen from the greater concentrations that occur for brief amount of times.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this.
