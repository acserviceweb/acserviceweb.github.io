<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning an organisation was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners must pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping costs the exact same in all other locations.<p>
