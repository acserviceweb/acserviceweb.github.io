<h3>HVAC Supply in Urbana Indiana</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>The compressor can get too hot and shut down if the condenser coils are blocked. You'll experience intermittent periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Turn off the power. Turn the cooling service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work correctly after you've cleaned the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC will not work totally unless you do this.<p>
