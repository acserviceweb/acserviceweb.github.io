In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite considerable.<p>
