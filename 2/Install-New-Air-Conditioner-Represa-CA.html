<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>
