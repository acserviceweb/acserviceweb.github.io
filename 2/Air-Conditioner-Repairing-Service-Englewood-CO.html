<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers utilized different methodologies. The CMHC research study gotten in touch with several duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they became part of a research study, and the researchers did not manage for time invested or approaches used. The EPA study prescribed and managed methods used on a smaller number of homes. While the duct-cleaning industry argues both studies have flaws, no other research study has actually challenged the findings. And although the equipment and approaches used by duct-cleaning companies have actually altered since these research studies were carried out, the air ducts in houses haven't.<p>
<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
