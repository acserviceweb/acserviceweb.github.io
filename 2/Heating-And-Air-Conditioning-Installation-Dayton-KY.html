<h3>Fixing Your Boiler in Dayton KY</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even little window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, extremely filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
