<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil.
