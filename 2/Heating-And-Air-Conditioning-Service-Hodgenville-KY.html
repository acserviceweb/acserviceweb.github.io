<p>We take a look at clues prior to we offer suggestions to change instead of repair a heating system. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy.

It may be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be squandering cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>

<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can become airborne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
