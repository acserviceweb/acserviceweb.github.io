<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you ought to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
