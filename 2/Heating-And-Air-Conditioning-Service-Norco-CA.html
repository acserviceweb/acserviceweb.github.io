<p>Lots of family items release natural vapors that can cause unfavorable health effects. These effects might consist of nose and throat inflammation, headaches, dizziness, and queasiness. Products consisting of these vapors include paints, strippers, fuels, solvents, pesticides, pastime supplies, deodorizers, disinfectants, and cleaners.

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
