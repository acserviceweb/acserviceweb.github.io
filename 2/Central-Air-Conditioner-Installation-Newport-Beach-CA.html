<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to watch out for is the dust that gathers during summers.

<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a large central air conditioner system that sits outside your house. Heatpump operate on electrical energy and work like air conditioners in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
