<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
