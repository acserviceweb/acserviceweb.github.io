<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price great however Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me regarding an abnormally high expense that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had actually spotted the trouble area in looking over the bill. He resolved the issue in one day, had changed the costs to what I thought about fair before he called back, knew what may have triggered the issue and had a strategy to insure that it would not happen again. I have considered All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have actually used them. This experience validates that.<p>
<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately harden and treat-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
