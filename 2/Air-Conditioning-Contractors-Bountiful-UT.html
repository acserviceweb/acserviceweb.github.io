Heating systems that kick on often might be due to an unclean filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>
