<h3>Clogged Air Filters in Newtown PA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause pricey compressor failure, but a property owner doesn't have the tools or skills essential to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and proper air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but property owners do not have the required devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician examine the system periodically.<p>
