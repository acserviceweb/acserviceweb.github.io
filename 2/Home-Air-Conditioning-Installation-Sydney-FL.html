<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ might observe moldy or undesirable odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems.
