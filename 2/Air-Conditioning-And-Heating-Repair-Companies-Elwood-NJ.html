<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>Brands carried: When looking for estimates for new or replacement heating or cooling devices be sure to ask prospective companies what particular producers or devices brands they carry.

<p>Sean was very handy. He is an extremely pleasant individual to work with. No pressure applied to purchase additional things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
