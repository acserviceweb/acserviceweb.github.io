<p>You're encouraging the growth of mold in moist air if you set it too low. The heat dries the air, preventing mold growth and pollution.

The perfect humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are prone to cold areas", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot next to the radiators. This normally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your home escape out of the window. Radiant heat offers warmth from the floor up throughout the space without any cold spots or stuffiness in the location being heated up.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ might notice moldy or unpleasant odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are becoming worse, talk to your physician about them. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>
