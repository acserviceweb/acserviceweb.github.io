<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source.

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports ought to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
