Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else other than changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is itâ and low $ s fantastic on energy saving too.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil.
