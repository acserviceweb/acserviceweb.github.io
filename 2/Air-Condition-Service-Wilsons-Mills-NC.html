<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to appropriately service and the unit has been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the floor surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are required to resist present, which then generates heat.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
