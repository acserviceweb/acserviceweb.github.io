<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00.

<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly minimizes direct exposure to pollutants during cooking. Incorrect adjustment, often shown by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame tip is blue. If you purchase a new gas stove or range, consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition due to the fact that it does not have a pilot burner that burns constantly. Never ever utilize a gas range to heat your house. When the fireplace is in usage, always make specific the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
