<p>Indoor environments are highly complex and building residents might be exposed to a range of pollutants (in the form of particles and gases) from office devices, cleaning items, building and construction activities, carpets and home furnishings, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure products, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outside pollutants.

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
