<p>A routine furnace tune up can go a long method towards minimizing a number of the problems caused by build-up of dirt and debris, and the examinations permit your contractor to keep an eye on longer-term issues and take proactive actions to help avoid early failure or inconvenient breakdowns during the heating season. Yearly furnace service may also be a requirement to keep your furnace service warranty valid as well.
