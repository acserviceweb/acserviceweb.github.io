<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
