<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioner into a heat pump While space cooling supplies maximum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is usually more expensive than central air.<p>
