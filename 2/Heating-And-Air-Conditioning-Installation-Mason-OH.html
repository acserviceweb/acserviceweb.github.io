<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely extensive in discussing what services would be carried out. Also Camryn offered excellent customer support at the end of the appointment by discussing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few ideas of some maintenance tasks we might wish to have done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques employed by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Your Review This is my third time using Around the Clock. Ilan always makes himself available - whether it's a heating concern in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more routine calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is competent with these gadgets).

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The objective is to supply sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A common element needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
