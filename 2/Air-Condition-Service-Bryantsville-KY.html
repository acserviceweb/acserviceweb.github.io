<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are likewise referred to as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to offer heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioning system into a heatpump While space air conditioning offers maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool numerous rooms at a time it is typically more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
