<p>Professional heater setups. For any contractor, HVAC or otherwise, these firms provide opportunities they can't achieve by themselves. Many owners stay with the larger companies after acquisition. Sometimes, the acquisition offers a method for the seller to retire and make sure employees are taken care of. For the many part, the acquiring companies desire the owner to stay. Reedy prefers the owners stay on and reinvest a part of their equity from the sale back into the company, although this isn't a requirement.<p>
<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be severe. They include delays in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Kids, infants, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead exposure than grownups since lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead. Children might have higher exposures considering that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
