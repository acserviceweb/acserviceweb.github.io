<h3>Gas Furnace Service in Fountain Hills AZ</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that the SEER rating is computed using the same set of temperature levels across the board. The average summer season temperature level to get to the SEER ranking is 83 degrees, so to arrive at the proper SEER rating for your area, subtract 2 points for every 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER ranking has to be at least 13 for all new cooling units made in the United States.<p>
<p>This is especially noteworthy, as gas ranges can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>I am very satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years earlier and know the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
