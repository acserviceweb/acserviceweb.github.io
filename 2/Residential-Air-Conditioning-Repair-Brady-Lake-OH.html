<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
