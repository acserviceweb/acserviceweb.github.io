<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, since it is secured indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical guidelines get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>

Performance scores must be identified with all units. While efficient units might cost more, going with an Energy Star-rated appliance is an excellent method to enjoy additional assurance.<p>

Your risk of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
