<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>HVAC is a fundamental part of residential structures such as single household homes, apartment, hotels and senior living centers, medium to large commercial and office buildings such as skyscrapers and medical facilities, cars such as vehicles, trains, planes, ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are controlled with respect to temperature and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, but many use the guideline that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is probably a much better option. If the existing system has actually not incurred other major repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and issues that led to the breakdown can be determined and treated, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense too.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is flowed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
