PTAC systems may be adjusted to offer heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heatpump While room air conditioning supplies optimum versatility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is typically more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
