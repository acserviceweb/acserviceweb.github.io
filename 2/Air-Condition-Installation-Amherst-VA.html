<h3>Home AC Repair in Amherst Virginia</h3>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
