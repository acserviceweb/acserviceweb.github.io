<p>Fact: Federal and local incentives normally total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can typically make the preliminary cost of a system competitive with conventional equipment. Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capacity, throughout brand-new building and construction (homes normally utilize in between one and five lots). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. However, new installation practices are lowering costs, to the point where the rate is getting closer to conventional systems under the best conditions.<p>
