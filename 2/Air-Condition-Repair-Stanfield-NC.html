<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, homes and offices matters, particularly since we invest the majority of our lives inside your home. A/c unit help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in exceptionally humid environments or in cases where the ac system is extra-large, it might not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioner will require more energy to cool your house.

<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up routinely, they can become clogged with debris that can restrict airflow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Dirty filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down completely. By comparison, checking and replacing a furnace filter can usually be done in just a few minutes, often without any tools needed. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
