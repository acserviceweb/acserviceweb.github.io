I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me difficulty shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again. He is truthful, trustworthy, and reasonable on rate. It's tough to find a sincere AC man and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
