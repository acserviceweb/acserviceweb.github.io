<h3>The Function of the Boiler Burner in North Houston TX</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the mathematics recently, however I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and want to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
