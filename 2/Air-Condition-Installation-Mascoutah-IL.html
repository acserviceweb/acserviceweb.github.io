Naturally, too-dry air can also aggravate your sinuses and lungs, while too much indoor humidity can contribute to the development of germs and infections, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
