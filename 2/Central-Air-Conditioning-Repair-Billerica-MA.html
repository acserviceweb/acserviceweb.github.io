<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product with time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
