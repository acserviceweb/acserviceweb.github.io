<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Essential Organisation in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are ranked 90% efficiency or much better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older designs, which might be ranked as low as 80% performance, this can indicate considerable cost savings in annual heating expenses. Modern two- and three-stage heaters increase effectiveness even further by performing at lower or higher capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
