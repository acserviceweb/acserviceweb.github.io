<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely handy. He is a very enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no issues besides the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
