<p>A packaged system, normally set up on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, however it is also an alternative for house owners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems contain not only the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged units are great for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, considering that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are normally just readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a good way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best option for house owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
