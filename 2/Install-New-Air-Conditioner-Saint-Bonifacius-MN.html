A lot of modern hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the circulation system (as opposed to older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air utilizing radiators, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators might be installed on walls or set up within the flooring to produce flooring heat.<p>
