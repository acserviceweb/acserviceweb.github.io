<p>Examine these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your home are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the issue.<p>
