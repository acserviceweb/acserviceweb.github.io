<p>As many of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory guarantees remain in place. In addition, the tangible outcomes of a PM is typically hard to quantify, as one response specified the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. The majority of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system don't just break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the result of recurring use of a component that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature degeneration, causing holes and cracks. If that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and secures the component.  a really useful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
