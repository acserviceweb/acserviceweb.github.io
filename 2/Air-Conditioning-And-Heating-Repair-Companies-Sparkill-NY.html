<p>Instant discounts on high-efficiency heat pump technologies are readily available to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Excellent Client Service!

<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your home still warms to the ideal temperature level. The temperature level of the air produced by the heat pump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel really hot. Only be worried if your house is not heating up. However, if your system does not seem working appropriately, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice.

<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood floor joist system, underneath the wooded subsurface and final floor finish.

To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>

<p>Volatile natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors.
