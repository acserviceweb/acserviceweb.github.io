Others were almost two times the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up team was considerate of my home and installed the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post install inspection outcomes look very good for braising and plumbing quality.
