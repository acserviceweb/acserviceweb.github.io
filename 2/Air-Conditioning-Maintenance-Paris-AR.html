<p>Dometic's commercial grade roof a/c are performance-tested to conquer uncommon or harsh roadway and weather. Numerous standard units break down after simply 4 hours of extreme vibration testing, while the Brisk II is still going strong at 30 hours and more! The galvanized steel top plate provides enduring strength while long copper lines decrease vibration and, for that reason, noise too. While being among the toughest a/c around, its 410A refrigerant is kinder to the environment. Robust, light-weight and capable of carrying out in any environment! It won't let you down.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Speed System because of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>The primary reason homeowners do not buy an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the amount of services offered. If the system is new and still under a producer's warranty, the cost may not be beneficial. Any major repairs must be covered under the manufacturer's service warranty. Nevertheless, some manufacturers need regular maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
<p>Many companies use third party guarantee companies - not YORK. YORK products are backed by some of the best limited guarantees in the business, including YORK's factory-backed warranty. Because these service warranties lead the HVAC industry in covering parts and essential mechanical parts, you can feel confident knowing you've selected the best furnace and ac system for your home or company.<p>
