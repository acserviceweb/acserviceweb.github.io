<p>The federal government suggests that homes be weatherized in order to minimize the amount of energy required for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, steps need to likewise be taken to lessen pollution from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for advised actions.) In addition, homeowners must look out to the introduction of indications of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization procedures need to not be undertaken up until these issues have actually been corrected.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very useful in gathering information on the phone and offering clear directions about how to momentarily deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and offered clear interaction about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
