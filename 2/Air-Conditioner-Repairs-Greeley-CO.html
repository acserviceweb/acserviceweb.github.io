<p>There are a couple of possibilities to discuss brief cycling in really winter. The most apparent is the possibility of the high needs placed on the system due to the extremely low temperature levels.

<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory warranties stay in location. Moreover, the tangible results of a PM is often tough to quantify, as one action specified the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or ac system do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the outcome of recurring use of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing early deterioration, leading to fractures and holes. , if that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the component.. a really beneficial result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
