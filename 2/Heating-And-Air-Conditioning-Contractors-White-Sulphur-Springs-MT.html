<p>Advanced ventilation systems that make it possible for higher air flow from the outdoors, air quality tracking platforms and sensors, and brand-new air filtration technologies are becoming more typical as offered options in residential and commercial HVAC product packages. Adoption of these technologies, however, has not been extensive, as consumers stay largely oblivious to the results of air quality on health and performance.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is filthy, and filters are plugged, and perhaps refrigerant is low, it will not be operating at maximum effectiveness and might overheat. This makes they HVAC system work harder, creating a cycle that doesn't end. An overworked system will also cause your energy expenses to rise. It's possible that the size of AC system you have is not big enough for your home. It will have to work more difficult and might get too hot if the system is too little. Generally, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to set up a 5-ton system for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot home.<p>
