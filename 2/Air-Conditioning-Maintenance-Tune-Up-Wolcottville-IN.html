<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine elements. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely.
