<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential structures has actually ended up being an important concern to property owners and health professionals. Indoor air contamination research studies have determined numerous pollutants that can be present in indoor air.

Proper ventilation and elimination of the sources of these contaminants are essential in preserving excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>There are numerous things to take into consideration when attempting to figure out how frequently I need to change my air conditioning filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has a special DNA on how it accumulates dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how often your a/c filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better best decision on how often your HVAC filters require replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less often you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with just one air conditioning filter require replacing regularly.<p>
