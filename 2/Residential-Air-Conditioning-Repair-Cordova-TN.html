As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
