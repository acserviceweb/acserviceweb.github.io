Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other elements that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
