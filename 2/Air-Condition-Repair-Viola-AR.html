<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
