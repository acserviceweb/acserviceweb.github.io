<p>A/c can also be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
