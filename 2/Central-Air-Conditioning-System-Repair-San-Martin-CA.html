<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location.

Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
