For example, a heat exchanger might fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing early deterioration, resulting in holes and cracks. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the component.  a very beneficial result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
