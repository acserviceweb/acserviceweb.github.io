<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies.

However, much of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Due to the fact that they eliminate moisture from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a generally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the system or flood the location.

<p>Sean was extremely handy. He is an extremely pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
