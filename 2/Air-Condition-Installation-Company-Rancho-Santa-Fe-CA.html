<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're most likely hearing the fan motor attempting to begin without the boost it needs from the capacitor. You can often conclude that the capacitor has failed. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the opportunities are great that this might work for one cycle, but the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's best to change the capacitor.<p>

Contaminants could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon entering your house from the ground listed below. An air toxin could also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, unstable natural substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or personal care items. Viruses and germs, family pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
