<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide car debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
