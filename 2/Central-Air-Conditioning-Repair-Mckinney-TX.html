<p>A geothermal heating system is more reliable than alternatives, and is not impacted by any external factors, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar energy. For instance, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar power counts on regular sunlight to work effectively. Geothermal heating depends on neither the sun nor the wind, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a reputable and offered source of energy.<p>
