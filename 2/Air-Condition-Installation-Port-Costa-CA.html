<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
