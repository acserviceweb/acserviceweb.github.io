<p>The probability of instant reactions to indoor air pollutants depends upon a number of factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 essential influences.

<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might choose to change the outside compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency unit. If you do so, seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the brand-new compressor is properly matched to the indoor unit. However, thinking about recent modifications in refrigerants and air conditioning styles, it might be better to replace the whole system.<p>
