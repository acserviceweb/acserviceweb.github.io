<p>Radiant heating systems don't use ducts, which makes them a fair bit more energy effective than other systems. They also do not develop cold and hot areas. All of the heat that radiant heating systems disperse moves through strong objects, keeping the heat near the floor of the room where it is the most use. Radiant heat systems can also heat spaces with less energy spent, and keep them heated for longer, because a lot of floorings tend to maintain heat better than air does.<p>

Also, keep fire security in mind when choosing where to install the a/c: Don't place it in an egress window that works as the only means of escape must a fire erupt.<p>
<p>Normally the most reliable way to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate private sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is likewise a more affordable approach to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later in this section.<p>
