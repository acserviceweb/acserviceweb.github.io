<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely since the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature degeneration, causing holes and fractures. , if that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the element.. a really helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
