<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives ask for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Ac system producers generally make rugged, high quality products. If your a/c unit stops working, begin by examining any merges or circuit breakers. Let the unit cool off for about 5 minutes prior to resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limit switch might have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, situated in the compressor's access panel.<p>
