<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, since it is secured inside. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical guidelines remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot in time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
<p>If your single phase a/c unit isn't old enough to justify replacement, think about an entire house dehumidifier. By installing dehumidification devices inside an existing single stage system, you can take pleasure in a few of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without changing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, enhancing indoor air quality and enabling higher convenience at higher temperatures.<p>
<p>This evaluation is for changing a 17 year old AC with a new AC, humidifier, air filtration system and thermostat. The technician who discussed our options did an excellent task in making sure we comprehended the advantages and disadvantages of each choice. The service technicians who installed the new system were expert and fast, while taking time to make sure we understood how the new system worked. Overall a very first rate experience.<p>
