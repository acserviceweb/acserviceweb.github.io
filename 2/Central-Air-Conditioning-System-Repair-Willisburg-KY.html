<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source.

Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
