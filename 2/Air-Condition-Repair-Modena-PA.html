<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps in Modena PA</h3>
<p>A hydronic radiant floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipelines installed under the flooring or right within the flooring surface itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the floor mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and people. It does not count on heating or moving air to move warmth.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

Presuming your budget accommodates a variable speed unit, you must definitely get one! You'll feel more comfy throughout the summer season, and your indoor air will be great deal cleaner.

<p>If the AC does not turn off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't produce heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen over time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must suffice up until you buy a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the idea of an in-floor heater appears less like a high-end product and more like a necessity.
