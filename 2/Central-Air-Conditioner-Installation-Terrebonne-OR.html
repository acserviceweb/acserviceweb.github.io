<p>Unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from products or procedures; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.
