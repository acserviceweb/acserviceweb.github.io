<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but your house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
