The likelihood of instant reactions to indoor air toxins depends upon numerous elements including age and preexisting medical conditions. In some cases, whether an individual reacts to a contaminant depends upon individual level of sensitivity, which varies significantly from individual to individual. Some people can become sensitized to chemical or biological contaminants after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>
