Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
