<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and likewise controling the temperature level of the flooring. All electrical wiring for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is unblocked and dry.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. A good place to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's kind of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there have not troubled with it!
