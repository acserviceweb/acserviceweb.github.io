<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heating unit, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space.

Thus, making sure the air is of good quality is the employer's task.<p>
