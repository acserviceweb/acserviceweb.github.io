<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
