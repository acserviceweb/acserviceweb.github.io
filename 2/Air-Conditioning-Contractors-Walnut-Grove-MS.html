<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price great but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
