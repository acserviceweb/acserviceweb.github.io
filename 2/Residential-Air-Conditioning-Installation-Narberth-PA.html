<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All things in the hot zone reach balance in temperature level after the convected heat system has been operating for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>Ventilation: Lowering pollutant concentration by utilizing cleaner (outside) air to water down contaminated (indoor) air. Local building regulations most likely define the amount (and in some cases quality) of outdoor air that must be constantly provided in your structures, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Momentarily increasing ventilation combined with proper usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be helpful in watering down the concentration of toxic fumes in the air.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary skills to do the task and also the morals to treat clients relatively. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the system has actually been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
