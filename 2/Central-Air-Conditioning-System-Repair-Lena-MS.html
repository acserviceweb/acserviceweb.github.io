<p>The federal government suggests that homes be weatherized in order to minimize the quantity of energy required for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions should also be taken to reduce contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for advised actions.) In addition, locals need to be alert to the introduction of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Additional weatherization procedures must not be undertaken till these issues have actually been remedied.<p>
<p>Though it may be hard to believe, the air inside your house can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are well-known for reducing the air quality in your house, however there are lots of other toxins that can not only dirty up the air, but lead to other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and building products contribute to poor air quality, and can also cause cancers. VOCs (volatile organic compounds) from paint and even from some kinds of carpets and upholstery materials can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>

The effects of CO direct exposure can vary greatly from person to person depending upon age, total health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
