My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12.

<p>Examine these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
