<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at East Prospect PA</h3>

All the wet hot air that travels through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then removed from the space that is being cooled. You'll have a water leak if your HVAC system is not draining properly. A limitation in your drain pipes triggers a water leak. There are many different locations a blockage can take place. One of the main locations where blockages start to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
