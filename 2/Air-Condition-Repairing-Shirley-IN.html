<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance in Shirley IN</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
