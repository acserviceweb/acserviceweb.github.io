<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, as opposed to industrial or outside settings.

<p>If you think a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Dripping return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

<h3>AC Unit Repair in Tanner AL</h3>
<p>The federal government recommends that homes be weatherized in order to minimize the quantity of energy needed for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, steps must also be required to reduce contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.)

<p>Great service within 24 hr and a reasonable price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and really extensive in discussing what services would be carried out. Similarly Camryn offered great customer care at the end of the visit by explaining precisely what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of ideas of some maintenance jobs we may wish to have carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies used by some in the market.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ may discover musty or unpleasant smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>
