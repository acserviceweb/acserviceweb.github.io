<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been stressed out from use. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the right temperature level. Furnaces that kick on regularly may be because of a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>
