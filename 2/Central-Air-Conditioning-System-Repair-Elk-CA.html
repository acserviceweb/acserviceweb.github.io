<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a reference in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
