<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
