A more energy efficient house will not just decrease the cost of a brand-new system and energy bills, however it will greatly enhance the comfort of your house. Before we style and set up any systems, we arrange a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will recommend improvements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these enhancements. Basic enhancements generally consist of adding insulation and air sealing procedures. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can suggest several certified home Energy Star auditors and installation professionals. Please Contact Us for recommendations.<p>
