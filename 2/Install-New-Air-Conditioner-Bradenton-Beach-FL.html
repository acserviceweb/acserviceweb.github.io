Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide ought to be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements.
