<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. When they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and tied them into a hot water supply, radiant heat systems have actually been around since the days of the Romans. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and an elementary pumping device to flow warm water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the harmony of the floor heat moved heat to other short articles in the rooms, consisting of the human occupants.<p>
<p>More typical in fairly older houses, a boiler-based heating system uses oil, gas or electrical energy to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in specific spaces. All-electric boilers can accomplish up to 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers should achieve 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers need to achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
