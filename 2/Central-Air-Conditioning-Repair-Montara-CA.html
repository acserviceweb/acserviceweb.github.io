<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ may see moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>

Vehicle parts manufacturers, aerospace producers and automobile makers are all within a few cents of each other at around $31 per hour, or over $64,000 per year. Trains are another high-wage employer, at an average of $29.33 per hour or $61,000 annually.<p>
