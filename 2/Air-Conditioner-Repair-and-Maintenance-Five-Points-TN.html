<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Don't place the condenser under a deck or entirely enclose it due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top. Any air flow constraint will lower the unit's efficiency. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
