<p>Open windows or use exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common technique of minimizing exposure to indoor air contaminants, also will lower but not eliminate direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke. Natural or mechanical ventilation strategies do not eliminate them from the air in your house as rapidly as they build up since cigarette smoking produces such big amounts of contaminants. In addition, the large increases in ventilation it takes to substantially lower exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can also increase energy expenses substantially. As a result, the most reliable method to lower direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the home is to eliminate smoking there.<p>
