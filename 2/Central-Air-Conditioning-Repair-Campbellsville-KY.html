<p>Before you head out and buy an air conditioning unit, there are a few things to choose first. Where are you going to be installing the a/c? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to install some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioning unit be? Too large and you'll encounter issues with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c and shorten its life. Too little and your ac system will not be able to cool the house correctly. When going shopping for a brand-new AC system, these are just a few of the elements that you require to take into account. Each choice can and will significantly impact your system's performance, which is why you can't pay for to overlook any of them.<p>
<p>Air pollutants can vary from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your pets to dangerous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a typical air contaminant arising from natural gas that leaves into your house without being burnt. Older homes may contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In bathrooms and cooking areas, mold and mildew can become a nuisance where moisture levels are usually higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you must inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
