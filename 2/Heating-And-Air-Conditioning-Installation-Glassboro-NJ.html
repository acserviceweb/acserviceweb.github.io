<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in tons. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs.
