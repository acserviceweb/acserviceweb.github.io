<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in tons. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>

Dust and dander are well-known for decreasing the air quality in your home, but there are lots of other pollutants that can not just dirty up the air, however result in other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and structure products contribute to poor air quality, and can also trigger cancers.

Germs or micro-organisms might also exist within the ventilation system. They might spread out throughout the entire work environment or building by ways of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do establish.<p>
