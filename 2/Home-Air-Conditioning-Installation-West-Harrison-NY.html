<h3>Facts All Homeowners Should Know About HVAC Installation in West Harrison NY</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating system. We chose getting something more costly than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
