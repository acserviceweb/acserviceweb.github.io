<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller home, which will impact installation expenses. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other aspects that can impact this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>A SEER score stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER ranking of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input throughout the exact same period. Essentially, SEER offers more information based on how the EER performs in different temps. The higher the system's SEER ranking, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>
