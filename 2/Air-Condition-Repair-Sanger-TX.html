Proper ventilation and elimination of the sources of these contaminants are very important in preserving good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price terrific however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
