<p>How climate change affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern-day ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This increase has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
