<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>An undersize system will not have the ability to cool spaces down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate due to the fact that it simply takes more electrical power to run a larger unit. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
