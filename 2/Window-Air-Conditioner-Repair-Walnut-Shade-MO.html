<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of various heating unit, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, go to Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
