<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
