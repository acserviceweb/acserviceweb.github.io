<p>Instantaneous discounts on high-efficiency heat pump technologies are offered to equipment installers, used at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Outstanding Client Service! Climate Pro is reliable and really appreciated us and our scenario. We got back one evening to a cold home. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came over that same night. Although he didn't have the needed replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could try to find and acquire it the next early morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely appreciative to have a heated home once again. What's most amazing was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to assist us right prior to a vacation, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will happily suggest this company to my friends.<p>
