<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment).

Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
