<p>All homes require effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been burnt out from use. Another possible factor could be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the right temperature. Heating systems that kick on frequently may be due to a filthy filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>

<h3>Maximizing the Efficiency of Your HVAC System in Virginia Beach VA</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on different home performance upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to help us discuss which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest savings. We never felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's product and services was excellent. Taylor assisted us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to perform the necessary electrical enhancements to save on cost.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also regulating the temperature level of the floor.
