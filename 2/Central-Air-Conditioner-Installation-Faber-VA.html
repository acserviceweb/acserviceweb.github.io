<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.

However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
