Too big and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c and reduce its life.

<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might want to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. If you already have a home heating system, you may search for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capacity and performance.

The good news is that the one major disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or very hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
