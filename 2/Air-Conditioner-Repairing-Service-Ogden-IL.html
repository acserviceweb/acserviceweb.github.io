Too big and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c and reduce its life. Too small and your air conditioning system will not have the ability to cool the house correctly. When going shopping for a brand-new AC system, these are simply a few of the elements that you require to take into account.

<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might want to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. If you already have a home heating system, you may search for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capacity and performance. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to try to find a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one major disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or very hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
