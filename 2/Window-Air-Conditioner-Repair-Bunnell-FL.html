<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young children can be extreme. They consist of delays in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Babies, fetuses, and children are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than grownups given that lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more conscious the harmful effects of lead.

<p>Sean was very helpful. He is a really pleasant person to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
