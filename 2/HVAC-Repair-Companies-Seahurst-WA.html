Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

At the very same time, the con would be that those who utilize this may invest more cash on cooling costs in the long run due to the fact that of the lower energy effectiveness.<p>
