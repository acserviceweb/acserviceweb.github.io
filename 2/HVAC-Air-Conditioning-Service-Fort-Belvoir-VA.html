<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Fort Belvoir VA?</h3>
<p>Many Canadian jurisdictions do not have specific legislation that deals with indoor air quality issues. In the absence of such legislation, the "general duty clause" applies. This provision, common to all Canadian occupational health and wellness legislation, specifies that an employer should supply a healthy and safe office. Therefore, making certain the air is of good quality is the employer's responsibility.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the system has been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
