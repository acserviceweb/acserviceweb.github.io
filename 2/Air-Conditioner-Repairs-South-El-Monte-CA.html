<p>Indoor impurities. These consist of chemicals utilized in the construction or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook ranges, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops need to be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems installed to remove products of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also produce particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
