<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to offer your house that best temperature throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those common air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can result in expensive repairs down the roadway. So, make sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service plan which usually includes a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
