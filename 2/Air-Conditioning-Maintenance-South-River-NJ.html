POLICE rates how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling impact. Most ground source heatpump have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this implies is that for each system of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the kind of heat.<p>
