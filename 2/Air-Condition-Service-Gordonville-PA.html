<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>

If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400?

She didn't need a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
