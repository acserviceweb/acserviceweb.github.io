<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
