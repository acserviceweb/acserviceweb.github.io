<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
