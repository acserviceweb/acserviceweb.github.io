<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Lynnwood WA Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
