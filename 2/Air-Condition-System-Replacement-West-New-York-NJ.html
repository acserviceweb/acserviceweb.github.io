<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release pollutants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
