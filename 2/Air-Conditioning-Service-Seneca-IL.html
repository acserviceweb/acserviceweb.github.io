<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two should not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for generating power in the form of electricity. The 2 operations utilize different processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be warmed to boiling point to accomplish its objectives.<p>
