<p>Truth: Federal and local rewards generally total up to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the preliminary price of a system competitive with traditional equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, during brand-new building (houses generally utilize in between one and 5 lots). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot.

<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that very same aquifer.
