<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Ferndale PA</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my organisations, my own homes and my property customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He assisted me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again. He is honest, trusted, and sensible on price. It's hard to discover a sincere AC man and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>I am really pleased with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years back and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
