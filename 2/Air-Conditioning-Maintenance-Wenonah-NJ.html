<p>The first air conditioners and refrigerators used poisonous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might result in fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical standards remove the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat with time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
