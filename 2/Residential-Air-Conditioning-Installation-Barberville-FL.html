<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go somewhere. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just asking for mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri. Mentioning laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a uncomplicated and efficient  technique to lower ambient air pollution and prospective health threats, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>Filters can get unclean quickly, specifically if you live in a place that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, particles, bacteria, and clean the air. They're responsible for keeping the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned up and replaced frequently, your HVAC system will eventually stop performing as you expect it to. The cooling and heating will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will get worse. Examining and altering the air filters is among the most important aspects of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>Damp and moist conditions breed mold and mildew that can trigger breathing problems like allergies and asthma. Depending on your location, the hot summer months can produce specifically humid conditions. Reduce the amount of wetness in the air and curb the growth of irritating molds with a few well-placed dehumidifiers. There are a variety of humidifier options that will help maintain constant humidity levels and create comfortable living conditions in your home.<p>
