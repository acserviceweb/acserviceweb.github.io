While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>
<p>Houses can have the same indoor air issues as single-family homes because many of the pollution sources, such as the interior building materials, furnishings, and household items, are comparable.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use vehicle debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
