<p>All Points Heating provides house cooling, ac system installation, air conditioning system maintenance that deliver trusted, tested efficiency at high performance.

<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a large central air conditioner system that sits outside your home. Heat pumps work on electrical energy and work like ac system in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>Throughout regular furnace operation, dust, dirt, moisture from humidity or condensation, and microbial developments can develop on internal elements. Airborne components from normal household products and surface areas can result in formicary deterioration within your HVAC devices.
