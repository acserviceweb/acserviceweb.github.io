<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time.
