<p>Indoor impurities. These include chemicals utilized in the building or remodelling of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops need to be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances must be sealed and power-vented systems installed to remove items of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning ranges can likewise produce particulates and must be vented outside.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce pollutants.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to supply enough changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A common component needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
