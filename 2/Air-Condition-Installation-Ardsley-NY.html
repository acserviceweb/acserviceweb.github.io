Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The goal is to provide adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A common aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
