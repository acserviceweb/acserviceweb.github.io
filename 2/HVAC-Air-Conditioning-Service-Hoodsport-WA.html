<p>When it comes to heated water or steam, piping is used to carry the heat to the rooms. Many contemporary hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the distribution system (rather than older gravity-fed systems ).

The radiators might be installed on walls or installed within the floor to produce floor heat.<p>
