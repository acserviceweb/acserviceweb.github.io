<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not use automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There ought to not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
