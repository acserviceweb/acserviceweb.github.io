Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
