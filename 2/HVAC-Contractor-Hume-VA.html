<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Hume VA</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present pattern in house construction is to lower air leak through cracks and other openings in walls, floors, and roofs. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the house.<p>

We'll visit your house for an extensive evaluation, consisting of an analysis of your existing ductwork and floorplan to find the very best system for your home.
