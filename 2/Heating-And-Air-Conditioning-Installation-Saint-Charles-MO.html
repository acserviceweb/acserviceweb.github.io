<p>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside your home. Most house heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather allows, or running a window a/c unit with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors remove pollutants straight from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
