<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do decline them up until they have been correctly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
