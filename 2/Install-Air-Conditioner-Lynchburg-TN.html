<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies.

Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
