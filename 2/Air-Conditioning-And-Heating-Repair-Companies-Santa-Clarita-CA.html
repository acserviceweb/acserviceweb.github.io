<p>The majority of people are aware that outside air pollution can affect their health, but indoor air contamination can also have substantial, damaging result.

Because it just takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
