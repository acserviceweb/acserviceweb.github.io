<h3>Air Condition System in Lovingston VA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
