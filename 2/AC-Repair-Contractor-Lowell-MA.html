<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not use auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash can be found in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to offer car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There ought to not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

We never felt hurried and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's product and services was remarkable. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to perform the needed electrical improvements to save money on cost.<p>
