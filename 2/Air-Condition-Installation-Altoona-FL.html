<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, given that it is protected indoors. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical guidelines remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot over time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
