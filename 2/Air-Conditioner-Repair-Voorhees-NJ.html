<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor.

Prior to that happens, you wish to get those capacitors altered to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
