Follow the producer's directions, particularly instructions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating system properly changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is normally a sign of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heater is in usage, open a door from the room where the heater lies to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
