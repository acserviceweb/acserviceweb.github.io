<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
