<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not provide this.
