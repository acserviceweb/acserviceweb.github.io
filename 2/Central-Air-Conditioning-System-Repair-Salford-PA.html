Standing water in humidifiers, air conditioning units, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can become polluted with fungis or germs and need to be gotten rid of, also. In some scenarios, particular screening for radon or for asbestos may be required as part of structure tenancy. For instance, in schools asbestos needs to be examined every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Danger Emergency Response Act-AHERA).<p>
