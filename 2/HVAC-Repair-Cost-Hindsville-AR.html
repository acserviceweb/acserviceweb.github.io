<p>There are a couple of possibilities to discuss short cycling in very winter. The most apparent is the possibility of the high demands put on the system due to the very low temperatures.

<p>Allergens are products that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can become airborne, and hence, are easily inhaled. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you consider a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of feline allergen could induce an asthma attack in people with feline allergic reactions, however not in those people who do not have feline allergies.<p>
<p>Often a short-lived indoor air quality problem is produced merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting area. In those cases, a short-term repair might be all that's required, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more complex issues-- determined by consistently inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will need a different tack. Depending on the concern you're experiencing, one of the 3 methods below may be proper.<p>
