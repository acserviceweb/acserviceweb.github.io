<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a tough task that the employees sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps guys working. When a sales male comes to your home he is there to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and should not "require" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I provide you the alternatives for your needs and you choose if you require it.<p>
