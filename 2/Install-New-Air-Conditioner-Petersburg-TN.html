<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not offer them.  Second of all like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to correctly service and the unit has actually been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
