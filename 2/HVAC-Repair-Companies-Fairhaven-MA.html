<h3>Factors to Consider When Looking for a Fantastic AC Repair Company at Fairhaven MA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his assessment, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't use them.  Second of all like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to effectively service and the unit has been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
