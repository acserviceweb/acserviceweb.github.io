<p>5. Smell great naturally. You might associate that lemony or piney aroma with a clean kitchen area or tidy synthetic scents in laundry items and air fresheners emit dozens of different chemicals into the air.

<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by individuals and animals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
