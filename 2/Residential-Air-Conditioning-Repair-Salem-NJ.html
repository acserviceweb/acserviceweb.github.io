<p>My eldest son constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it actually didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly consider anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is low and itâ $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around fixing the issue, all the while discussing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working effectively. He needed to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
