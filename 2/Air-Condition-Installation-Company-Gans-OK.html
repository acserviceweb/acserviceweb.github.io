<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>While toxins frequently discovered in indoor air are responsible for numerous hazardous impacts, there is considerable uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of exposure are necessary to produce specific health problems. Individuals also react very in a different way to exposure to indoor air pollutants. Further research is needed to much better understand which health impacts take place after direct exposure to the typical toxin concentrations discovered in homes and which take place from the higher concentrations that take place for short time periods.<p>
<p>Practically half of Americans use air fresheners at least once a week, and 34 percent usage candles or incense that often, our nationally representative survey discovered. Approximately 40 percent hardly ever or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have actually never ever cleaned or replaced their furnace filter. And nearly 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
