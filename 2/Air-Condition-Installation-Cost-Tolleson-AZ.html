<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the traditional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the standard water heater can be turned off completely.<p>

Other radiators are still utilized, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heaters-- although ceiling radiators are usually utilized in commercial applications like storage facilities.<p>
