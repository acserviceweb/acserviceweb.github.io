<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
