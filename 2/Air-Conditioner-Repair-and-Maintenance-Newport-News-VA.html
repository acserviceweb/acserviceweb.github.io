<h3>Powerful Methods for Furnace Cleaning in Newport News VA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by improving air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, determined particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

Since cigarette smoking produces such large amounts of pollutants, natural or mechanical ventilation techniques do not remove them from the air in your home as quickly as they build up. In addition, the large increases in ventilation it takes to substantially minimize exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can likewise increase energy expenses considerably. Consequently, the most efficient method to reduce exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the house is to eliminate cigarette smoking there.<p>
