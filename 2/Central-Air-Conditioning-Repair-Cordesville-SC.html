<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to assist keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house.

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct.
