<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
