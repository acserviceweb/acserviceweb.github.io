<p>Another method to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside your home. A lot of house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home.

Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors remove pollutants straight from the room where the fan is located and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
