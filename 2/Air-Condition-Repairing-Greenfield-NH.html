<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
