<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
