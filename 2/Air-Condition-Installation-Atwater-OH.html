<p>These guys have been terrific. At a realtor, I sometimes need contractors to give me a viewpoint for what work on a home might cost. Recently I required to contact these men twice. They came out quickly and offered me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer probably would not wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the honesty. Stability isn't just their name, its a service design they take seriously. You people are formally on speed dial. Talk with you soon.<p>
<p>When our furnace was dying, we called two local companies for bids. While both were useful and valuable, Ballard Gas offered us a much better offer, for exceptional service. Rather than a simple sales task, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heating system and located ways we might have more even heat. He included these significant however small modifications in his quote. We decided to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heatpump since of recent warmer summertimes and for environmental reasons.<p>
