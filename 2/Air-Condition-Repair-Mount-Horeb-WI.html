<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
