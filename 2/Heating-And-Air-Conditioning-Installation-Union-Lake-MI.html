An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the exact same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly harden and cure-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
