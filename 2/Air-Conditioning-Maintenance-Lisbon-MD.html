<h3>Facts All Homeowners Should Know About HVAC Installation in Lisbon MD</h3>

<p>Oil furnaces tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be correctly vented and cleaned from the furnace regularly. Modification the filters occasionally and have your ductwork cleaned up because the soot develops inside the ducts, decreasing their effectiveness with time.
