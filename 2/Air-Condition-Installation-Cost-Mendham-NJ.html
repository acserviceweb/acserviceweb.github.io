<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Mendham NJ</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  unit instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
