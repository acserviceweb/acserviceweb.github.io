On the day of the consultation he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent educating me about our system, and left having resolved the problem with an easy repair he did on-site, not replacing the whole part. He got along, straightforward and a thoroughly enjoyable individual to have around that entire time.

<p>Fantastic Item! Shipment was type of weird being that package was opened and products might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was incredibly lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: buy advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with assistance, we fixed concerns.
