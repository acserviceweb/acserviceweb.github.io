<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task.

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
