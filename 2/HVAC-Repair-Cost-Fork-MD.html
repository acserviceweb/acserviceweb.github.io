<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have concerns, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended guarantees or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
