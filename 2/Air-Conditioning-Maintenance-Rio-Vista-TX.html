<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn On Your Air Conditioner at Rio Vista TX</h3>
<p>After living in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the a/c. I went ahead and purchased this Carrier and I should state it does the job quite well. It takes extremely little time to warm up or cool down the house which is among the things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had before. The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix used in vehicles in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by licensed HVAC service technicians. For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by lots of people.<p>
