<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that perfect temperature throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those common air toxins. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can cause expensive repairs down the road. So, make sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service plan which normally includes a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Consider possible effects of indoor air contamination if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit. Follow the producer's directions, specifically instructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heater effectively adjusted. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is usually an indication of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heater remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heating system is located to the remainder of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
