Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace choice, ask your contractor to examine not simply the condition of your existing devices, however likewise the ducts that provide the cool air and the overall quality of the insulation in your home.

<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future.
