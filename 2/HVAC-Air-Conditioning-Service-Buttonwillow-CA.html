Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely thankful to have a heated house again. What's most incredible was that this all occurred throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to assist us right before a vacation, however Environment Pro came through for us. I will gladly suggest this company to my pals.<p>
