To make sure the system you pick is the best size for your home, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load calculation price quote to identify the exact type of heat and air conditioning system that's perfect for your home-we do not just replace it with the same size unit you presently have. These calculations take into account things such as the size of your house, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
