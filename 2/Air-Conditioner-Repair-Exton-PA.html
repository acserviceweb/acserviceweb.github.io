<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up frequently, they can become obstructed with debris that can limit airflow, potentially impacting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Dirty filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down totally. By contrast, checking and changing a furnace filter can typically be done in simply a few minutes, often without any tools needed. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace in Exton PA?</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the math lately, however I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the patio area where the unit sits. I feel like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>

<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me regarding an uncommonly high costs that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of issue.
