We clean up, sanitize, and preserve surfaces to improve their longevity, appearance, or efficiency. In other cases, such changes subtly or perhaps dramatically change buildings in ways that might be necessary to their own stability or their impact on building occupants through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological procedures that specify them at any time.

To avoid CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable effect on occupants-- outside air should be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
