<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.. Second of all like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly.
