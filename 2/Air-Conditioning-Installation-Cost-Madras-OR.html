<p>You could upgrade to the highest performance gear readily available and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days. That's since the mechanicals are just part of the central air system. The average home's ductwork leakages 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your living space, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before deciding whether to repair or change your condenser and blower systems, your technician must run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring how much air escapes the system.<p>
