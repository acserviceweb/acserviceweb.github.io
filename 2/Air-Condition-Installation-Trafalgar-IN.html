<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts decades, because it is safeguarded indoors. When it does require to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from inside and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
