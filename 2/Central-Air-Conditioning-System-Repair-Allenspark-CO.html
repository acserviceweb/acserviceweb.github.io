<p>When mounting a wall sensing unit, consider the height at which they should be placed. Most typically they are installed at height-level or a little lower, if individuals primarily remain seated in that specific area. However, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate towards the floor or ceiling; depending upon what pollutant you're attempting to track you'll need to put the sensing unit accordingly. For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside buildings are typically near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is heavier than air and stays near the floor.<p>
