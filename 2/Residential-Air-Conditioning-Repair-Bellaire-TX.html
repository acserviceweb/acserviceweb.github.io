<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO protect the performance and performance of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor wisely, much of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales tactics that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
