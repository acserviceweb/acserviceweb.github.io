<h3>Heating And Cooling Systems in Chatsworth CA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
