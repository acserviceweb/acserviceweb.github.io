Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
