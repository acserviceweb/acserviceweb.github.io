<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a recommendation later). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
