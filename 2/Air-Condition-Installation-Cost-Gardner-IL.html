<p>Examine these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the issue.<p>
