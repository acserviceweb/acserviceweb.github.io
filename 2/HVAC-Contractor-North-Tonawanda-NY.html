As a society, we ensure that our houses are well-insulated and well-sealed, but we do not think adequate about exposure to all the important things we put in our houses," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a big impact on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, dizziness, queasiness-- right away, they can come on years after direct exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

<h3>Common Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in North Tonawanda NY</h3>
<p>Another method to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside your home. A lot of home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window ac system with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors remove pollutants straight from the room where the fan lies and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven. When the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips, screeching sounds from a belt-drive air handler normally take place. For the most part, the belt is incorrectly lined up or used and requires replacement. Follow the directions above under Air conditioning unit Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's manual.<p>
