<p>When our furnace was passing away, we contacted two local companies for quotes. While both were informative and practical, Ballard Natural Gas offered us a better deal, for remarkable service. Instead of a basic sales task, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heating unit and situated ways we could have more even heat. He included these significant however small modifications in his quote. Because of current warmer summer seasons and for environmental factors, we decided to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and banned using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
