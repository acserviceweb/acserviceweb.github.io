<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent.

Attempt a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
