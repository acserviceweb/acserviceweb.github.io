Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>

Their techs are professional and extremely experienced. Costs are sensible. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff set up a new air handler and condenser today. I did not bother to get competitor's quotes because of my trust in Waychoff since the cost was obviously affordable.<p>
