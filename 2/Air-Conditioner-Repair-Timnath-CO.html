<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not use them.  Secondly like prolonged car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to correctly service and the system has actually been operating problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
