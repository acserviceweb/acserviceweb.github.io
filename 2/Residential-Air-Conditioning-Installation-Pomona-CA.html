<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, work environments and schools matters, especially because we invest the majority of our lives inside. A/c unit help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in incredibly damp environments or in cases where the a/c unit is large, it might not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the ac system will require more energy to cool your home. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>If you operate in building and construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator service center or lead factory, or your pastime includes lead, you may unknowingly bring lead into your home on your clothing or hands.

Soil by highways and roadways might be infected from years of exhaust fumes from vehicles and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to wipe your feet prior to going into the home.

Encourage your children to play in sand and grassy areas rather of dirt which sticks to toys and fingers. Attempt to keep your kids from consuming dirt, and make sure they clean their hands when they come inside.<p>
