They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to purchase it. My wife said that she had seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most decent individuals I have actually fulfilled in a long time. If we wish to have options to ACME heating, we require to support the real people who are there for us.
