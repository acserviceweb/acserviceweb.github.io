<p>Air conditioners can develop a lot of water since they remove wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To deal with condensate issues, please see Ac system Leaks Water, below.<p>

<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
