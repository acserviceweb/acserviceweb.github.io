<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most inexpensive if your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 need to be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements used for calculations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be required.<p>
<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your home's square video footage.
