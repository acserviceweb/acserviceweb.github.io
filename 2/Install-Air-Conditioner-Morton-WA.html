Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the very same time, because the total capability of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Basically, the outside system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that a few of the rooms might not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not simple, since it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the units, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
