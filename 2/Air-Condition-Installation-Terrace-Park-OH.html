<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
