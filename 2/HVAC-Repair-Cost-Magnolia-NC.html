<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, homes and work environments matters, particularly because we invest most of our lives inside your home.

Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioner will need more energy to cool your home. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>A Trane air conditioner can range in cost from $4,000 - $10,000. Our pricing guide describes all the elements that impact your price. The cost of your air conditioner will differ depending on the size of your house, model you select, special installation requirements - even where you live and the environment in your location.

<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
