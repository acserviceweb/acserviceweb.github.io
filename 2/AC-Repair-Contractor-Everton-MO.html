<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the ac system back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
