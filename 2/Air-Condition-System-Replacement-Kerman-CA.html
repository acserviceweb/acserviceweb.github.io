<p>Regular maintenance keeps a furnace working effectively, according to HVAC specialists like Dave Mejean of B&W Pipes & Heating in Indianapolis. When you're running an HVAC company, you're on board for all the ups and downs that include owning a high-demand, seasonal company. A thoroughly crafted business plan for an HVAC company is the first step to handle those lulls and peaks so your earnings remain healthy year-round.

Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capacity, during brand-new building and construction (houses generally utilize in between one and five lots). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. However, new installation practices are reducing costs, to the point where the cost is getting closer to standard systems under the best conditions.<p>

<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't remove the mold.

The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Evaluation your records from tracking your service calls, installation sales, service contracts and other sales, in addition to the earnings and revenue for each category.
