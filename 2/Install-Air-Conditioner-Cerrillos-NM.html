<h3>How to Limit the Costs of Air Conditioner Repair at Cerrillos NM</h3>
<p>Elements that can contribute to the growth of biological pollutants are damp or damp structure products (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and poorly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c. "Humidifier fever" is a common disease triggered by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Numerous fungi and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these impurities can be dispersed into the air and inhaled by the structure occupants. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are pets and family plants.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
