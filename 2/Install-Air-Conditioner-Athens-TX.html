<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major devices manufacturer's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in place. Additionally, the concrete results of a PM is frequently hard to measure, as one action specified the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided.

For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering early deterioration, resulting in cracks and holes. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and secures the element.  a really useful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
