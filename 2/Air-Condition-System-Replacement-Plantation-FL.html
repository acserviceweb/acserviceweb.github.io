<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner in Plantation FL</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in home building and construction is to minimize air leakage through fractures and other openings in floorings, roofing systems, and walls. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air waters down indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
