<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, ceiling, wall, and flooring coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 48 hours might become a source for mold growth and should be discarded. Sometimes there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can thrive in concealed or seldom accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products including carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the wetness issue, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely clean the area using recognized health department suggestions.<p>
