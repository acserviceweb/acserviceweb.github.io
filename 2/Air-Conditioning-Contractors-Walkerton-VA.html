<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
