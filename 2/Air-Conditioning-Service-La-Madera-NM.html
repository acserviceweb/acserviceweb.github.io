<h3>Air Conditioner Repair in La Madera NM</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for years for my businesses, my own homes and my real estate clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, trusted, and reasonable on rate. It's hard to find a truthful AC man and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>If you're trying to find an honest, hard-working, very trustworthy, & well-informed a/c & heating contractor - provide All the time a call! I was originally referred to Ilan & his group by numerous of my next-door neighbors when I relocated 5+ years earlier.

They're terrific with the communications - phone, text, email! I put allot of value on a small company owner who lives in the neighborhood he services.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is typically essential to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such details can in some cases be gotten by requesting copies of air tracking information from the company. If keeping an eye on information is not readily available, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union agent must ask for that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted. Evaluation of this information might determine possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. However, when pollutant concentrations are really low, keeping an eye on data may not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
