<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, class or lab environments, instead of commercial or outdoor settings. In jobs where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

It may also consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork connects to specific spaces.<p>
<p>A SEER rating represents Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at differing temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input throughout the exact same period. Basically, SEER offers more information based on how the EER performs in various temps. The greater the unit's SEER rating, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER score can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all appliances.<p>
