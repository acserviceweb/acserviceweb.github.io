<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most economical if your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>A/c can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>

Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is typically higher than numerous heat pump options, they can still be extremely efficient, depending upon the design you purchase. One of the main benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion procedure, it will heat the air to greater temperatures than other heating options. This indicates it can warm up your home to the desired temperature quicker than a heat pump can.<p>
