<p>The purpose of a lot of building ventilation systems is to bring in adequate fresh air for occupant convenience while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and constructing safety at affordable energy expenses. Load determining is referred to as the Handbook J computation and need to be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to offering an installation or unit cost for air conditioning.
