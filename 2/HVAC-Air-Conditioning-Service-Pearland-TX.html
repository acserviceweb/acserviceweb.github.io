<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning unit back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, location two 2x4s below package to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
