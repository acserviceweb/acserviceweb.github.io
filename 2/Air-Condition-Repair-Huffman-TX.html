<p>Equipment expenses are driven by the kind of furnace at the heart of your house heater. Low-efficiency designs will cost less, however lead to greater energy expenses. High-efficiency designs cost more, however save more over the long haul. Prices for gas heating systems range from $1,360 for the low-efficiency designs up to $12,500 for high-efficiency models. Electric furnaces start at $395 and range approximately $1,700 or more depending upon the brand name and furnace size.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is absorbed from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>

The heating, ventilation and air conditioning business tends to run cold and hot. When customers require their HVAC systems repaired for relief against the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather condition arrives, demand heats up during the summer season and winter.<p>
