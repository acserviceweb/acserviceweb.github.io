<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside system as near your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
