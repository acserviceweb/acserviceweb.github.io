<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate excellent however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced.
