<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. When the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly harden and cure-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
