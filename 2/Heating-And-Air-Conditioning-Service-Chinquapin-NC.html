<p>I have been using them for several years for my organisations, my own homes and my realty customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again. He is honest, dependable, and sensible on rate. It's difficult to discover an honest AC guy and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
