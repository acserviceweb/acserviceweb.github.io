<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
