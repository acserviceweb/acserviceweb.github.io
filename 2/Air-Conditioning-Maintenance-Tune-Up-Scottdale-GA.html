<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
