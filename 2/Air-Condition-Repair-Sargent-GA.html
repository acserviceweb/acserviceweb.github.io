<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ might notice unpleasant or musty smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse, talk with your physician about them. But not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for excellent structure management.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, often referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the floorings, walls, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the a/c unit to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
