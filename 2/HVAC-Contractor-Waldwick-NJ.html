<p>Underfloor heating is easy to install, specifically if you make it part of a construct or remodelling job. For example, Warmup's StickyMat solution can be installed as a Do It Yourself task as it is basic to set with the electric wire being all pre-spaced and readily connected to the mesh, all set to be rolled out in location. Plus, there's even an added cleaning benefit as keeping the rooms dust-free is easier without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>
