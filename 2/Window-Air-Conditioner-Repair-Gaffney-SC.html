<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
