<p>Using air filters can trap a few of the air contaminants.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
