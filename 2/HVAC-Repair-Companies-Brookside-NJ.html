<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was very handy in collecting info on the phone and offering clear directions about how to momentarily deal with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and used clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention.
