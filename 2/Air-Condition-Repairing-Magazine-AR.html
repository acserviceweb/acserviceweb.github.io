<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not provide car debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>The likelihood of instant reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon a number of factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important influences. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a pollutant depends upon individual level of sensitivity, which differs significantly from individual to person. Some people can become sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical contaminants as well.<p>
<p>Unclean Filters: â $ " Â Filters blocked with dust, pet hair and other debris result in problems like failure to offer appropriate heat, excess noise and the furnace running all the time. If you discover the issue and have a washable filter, thereâ $ s no charge. Do It Yourself filter replacement alternatives range from $3 to $40, and you get what you pay for. That might be a very costly dirty-filter diagnosis if the technician comes to your home.

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect affecting indoor air quality, but it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there are in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have a negative impact on residents-- outside air needs to be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
