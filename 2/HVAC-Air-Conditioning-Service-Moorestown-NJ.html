These convection heating systems are still extensively used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

Not just was the cost terrific however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
