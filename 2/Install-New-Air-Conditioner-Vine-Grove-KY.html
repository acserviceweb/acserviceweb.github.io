<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off contaminants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system, consider potential results of indoor air pollution. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, specifically instructions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating unit properly adjusted. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is generally a sign of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heating unit is in usage, open a door from the space where the heating system lies to the rest of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
