<p>We take a look at hints before we provide recommendations to change rather than repair a heating unit. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are greater year after year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It might be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing cash by not replacing the older system.<p>
