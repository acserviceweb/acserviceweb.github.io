<p>Rising energy costs are not the only reason for high costs. Heating systems often lose their efficiency as they age, particularly if they have actually not been effectively maintained. As an outcome your oil or natural gas furnace may run longer to provide the exact same quantity of heat. This will cause your energy bills to increase. And, all of the cash you pay your energy utility companies every month could be used to help you spend for a new, much more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your recent heating costs with heating bills from the previous years. If there is a considerable difference, then it's time to replace your furnace.<p>

<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists if no contaminant sources are found. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions. Stagnant air has higher levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not enough to account for a boost in the number of employees in the location, stagnant air might also be an issue.<p>
<p>There is a needed balance in making your choice though as systems with higher AFUE ratings typically include greater cost. So, make sure to choose based on how typically you will use your heating system, the load that will be placed on it and the frequency with which you plan on having it serviced each year. For the majority of temperate climates with low heating loads in the winter, having an incredibly high ranked heater is not constantly required.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it extremely quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
