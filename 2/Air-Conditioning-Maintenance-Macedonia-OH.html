<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner boost. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and individuals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>
