<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Issues in Fanwood NJ</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heater. We picked getting something more costly than a standard water heater as gas is among our biggest utility costs. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood just what the problem was and fixed it very quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
