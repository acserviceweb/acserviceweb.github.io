<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. Because it just takes more electrical energy to run a larger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize system does not lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In fact, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>

<h3>House Ventilation in Linn Creek MO</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Great service within 24 hr and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was very comprehensive and on-time in describing what services would be performed.

He made a few recommendations of some maintenance tasks we might wish to have actually done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale methods employed by some in the industry.<p>
