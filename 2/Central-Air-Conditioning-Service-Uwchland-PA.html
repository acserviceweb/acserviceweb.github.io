In truth, you can even Do It Yourself, regardless of our strong recommendation not to do so.

Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
