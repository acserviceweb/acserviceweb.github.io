<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

<h3>Advantages of Purchasing on Gas Furnaces at Howe OK</h3>
<p>Your lungs are responsible for bringing fresh air into your body, while simultaneously eliminating waste gases and particulates.

Poor air quality - whether it is indoors or outdoors - can make it increasingly challenging for your lungs to function appropriately, and can have unfavorable health affects.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
