<p>Current Review: They were great! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially requested. They satisfied my needs totally by offering a professional quote with choices, without pushing additional products. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The also immediately followed up with the needed examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
<p>Start by checking out the installation manual and acquainting yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners. Most units feature a set that consists of adjustable window extensions and metal mounting brackets. These parts will guarantee an airtight and secure fit in the window opening. And for additional support, particularly for bigger a/c, think about buying a steel assistance bracket and install it to the outside home wall, straight below the windowsill.<p>
