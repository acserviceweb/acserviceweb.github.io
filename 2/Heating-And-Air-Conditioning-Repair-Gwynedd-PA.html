<p>Particular instant impacts are similar to those from colds or other viral illness, so it is frequently difficult to identify if the symptoms are a result of direct exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is very important to take notice of the time and place the symptoms happen. If the symptoms fade or go away when an individual is far from the home and return when the individual returns, an effort ought to be made to determine indoor air sources that might be possible causes.

In this case, the control system is very crucial to maintaining an appropriate temperature level.<p>
