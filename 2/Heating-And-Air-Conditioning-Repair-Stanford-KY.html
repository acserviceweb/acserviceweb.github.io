<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas.

When radon becomes caught in structures and concentrations build up inside your home, direct exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>

<p>It may feel cozy being sealed in tight against the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, but for people who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have breathing issues, winter can intensify problems. Stagnant indoor air and heating unit can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing allergen, pet dander, and mold spores flowing through your house. In late winter and early spring, it might still be too chilly to throw open the windows to pull out the musty air, so while you await the warmer weather condition it's important to be knowledgeable about some of the allergy and respiratory triggers that might be hiding in your environments.<p>
<p>Some biological pollutants trigger allergic reactions, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma. Infectious health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transferred through the air. Molds and mildews release disease-causing contaminants. Symptoms of health problems triggered by biological toxins consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, sleepiness, fever, and gastrointestinal problems.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time repairing the problem, all the while explaining everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
