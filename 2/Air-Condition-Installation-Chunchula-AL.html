<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s below package to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the flooring level.

All items in the hot zone reach balance in temperature level after the radiant heat system has actually been operating for a while, including people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off.<p>
