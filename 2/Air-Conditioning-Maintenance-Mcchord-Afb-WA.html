<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Mcchord Afb WA</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most inexpensive. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the need to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best feature of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Producers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the issue and repaired very rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
