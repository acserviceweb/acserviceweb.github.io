<p>A hydronic radiant floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipes set up under the flooring or right within the flooring surface itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the flooring mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and people. It does not rely on heating or moving air to move heat.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
