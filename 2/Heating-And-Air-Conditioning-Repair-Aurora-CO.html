<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Aurora CO</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outdoor  unit instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor system. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Oil heaters tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be effectively vented and cleaned from the furnace routinely. Change the filters periodically and have your ductwork cleaned because the soot builds up inside the ducts, lowering their effectiveness in time. Expect to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
