<p>An undersize system will not have the ability to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run since it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate since it just takes more electricity to run a bigger system. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a chance to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature shows. In truth, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
