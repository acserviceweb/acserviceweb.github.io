<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in Churubusco IN</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a tube two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electricity open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
