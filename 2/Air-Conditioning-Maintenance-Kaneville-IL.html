Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
