<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, as opposed to outside or commercial settings. In tasks where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

<p>Radiant heat provides a number of unique benefits over forced air heating systems. For instance, radiant heat systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems.

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
