<p>Immediate results might show up after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate results are typically short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is simply eliminating the individual's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized. Signs of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might likewise show up soon after exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>
