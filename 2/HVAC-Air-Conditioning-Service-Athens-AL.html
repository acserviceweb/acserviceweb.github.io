<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
