<h3>Water Boiler Repair in Clawson MI</h3>
<p>We got in touch with Elite HVACS on one of the most popular days of summer season( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out very same day to examine scenario & decided to opt for them for the work. I more than happy to say that not only did we get the central air going but likewise changed the heating unit which was old. Everybody we spoke to from starting to end were very expert, polite and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Makers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they identified the problem and repaired extremely quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Filters can get dirty quickly, especially if you live in a location that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, debris, bacteria, and tidy the air. They're responsible for preserving the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned up and changed frequently, your HVAC system will ultimately stop carrying out as you expect it to. The heating & cooling will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will intensify. Checking and changing the air filters is one of the most crucial elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service contract tries to upsell you each time they come to carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for seven years, although it was six months prior to the present one ended. She didn't need a air filtering system, however they talked her into it.<p>
