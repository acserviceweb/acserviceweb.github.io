<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my businesses, my own homes and my realty customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he encouraged me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the concern. He is sincere, trusted, and sensible on cost. It's tough to find a truthful AC guy and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
