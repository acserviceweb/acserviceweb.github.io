<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
