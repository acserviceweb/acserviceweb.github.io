<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price great however Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
