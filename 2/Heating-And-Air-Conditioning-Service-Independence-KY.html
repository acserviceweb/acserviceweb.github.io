<p>HVAC is a fundamental part of residential structures such as single household homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to big industrial and office complex such as high-rise buildings and medical facilities, automobiles such as cars and trucks, trains, aircrafts, ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are controlled with respect to temperature level and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is normally higher than many heat pump alternatives, they can still be extremely efficient, depending upon the design you buy. One of the primary benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to higher temperature levels than other heating alternatives. This means it can warm up your home to the wanted temperature quicker than a heat pump can.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a building." Those procedures include generating outdoors air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the building, and moving some part of indoor air outside. The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
