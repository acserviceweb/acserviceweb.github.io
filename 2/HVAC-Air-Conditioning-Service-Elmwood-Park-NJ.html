<p>The contaminants noted in this guide have been shown to cause the health impacts mentioned.

<p>Some biological pollutants activate allergies, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
