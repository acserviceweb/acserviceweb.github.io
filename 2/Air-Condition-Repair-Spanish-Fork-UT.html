<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company used 98% of the existing product purchased with your home. This company presented a service agreement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and plumbing.

<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Spanish Fork UT</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating unit. We picked getting something more expensive than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
