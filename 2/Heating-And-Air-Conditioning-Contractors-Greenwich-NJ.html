<p>Employ specialists and treat them well: Inspired, well-compensated professionals perform much better work than transient subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success.

<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ might observe unpleasant or moldy smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>
