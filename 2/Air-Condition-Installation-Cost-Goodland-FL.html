<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible.

If products with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent sees, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
