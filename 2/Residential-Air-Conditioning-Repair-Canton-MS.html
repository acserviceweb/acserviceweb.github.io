<p>An undersize system will not have the ability to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. Since it simply takes more electrical power to run a larger unit, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
