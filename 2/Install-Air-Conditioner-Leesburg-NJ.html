<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Things HVAC Repairin Leesburg NJ</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively easy to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants emitted by people, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are abnormally high inside might cause occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Inspect these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in the house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
