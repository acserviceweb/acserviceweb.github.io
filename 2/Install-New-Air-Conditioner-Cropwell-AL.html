<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and effectively, however to have 2 major components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by warranty.

Maybe Real estate agents should consider too many variables to definitively state what a radiant heating system may contribute to, or deduct from, any offered asking cost. That said, property buyers looking to go green," who focus on energy savings, or who absolutely want an in-floor heating system will be willing to pay a premium for a house that includes one.<p>
