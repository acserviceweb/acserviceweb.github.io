<h3>Heat Ventilation And Air Conditioning in Troy NC</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
