Other elements that can affect this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>More typical in fairly older houses, a boiler-based heating system utilizes electricity, gas or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in specific rooms. All-electric boilers can attain up to 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers should accomplish 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers must accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
