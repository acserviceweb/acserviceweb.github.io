I have actually thought about All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have actually used them. This experience confirms that.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most heating systems have multiple control boards. The biggest, or only one in some heaters, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the brand-new control board should be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t appropriately diagnosed, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
