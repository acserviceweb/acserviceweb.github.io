<p>Many people underestimate the level of the indoor air pollution problem. Air pollution is generally pictured as the black smoke given off from factories. Little thought is offered to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays, paints, cleaners, and pesticides utilized in the house. To intensify the problem, it is approximated that the average American spends 70 percent to 90 percent of his/her time inside, and more than half that time is spent in the house.<p>
<p>Some health impacts may show up shortly after a single direct exposure or duplicated direct exposures to a pollutant. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such instant results are typically short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is merely eliminating the individual's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified. Soon after direct exposure to some indoor air pollutants, signs of some diseases such as asthma may show up, be worsened or intensified.<p>
<p>A specialized a/c unit that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioning unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the exact same air course. Since its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, considering that all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is actually heated, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
