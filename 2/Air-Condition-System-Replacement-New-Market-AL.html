<h3>Furnace Repair Cost in New Market Alabama</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, however to have two significant elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>Because they eliminate wetness from the air, Air conditioners can develop a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a generally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In truth, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To deal with condensate issues, please see Ac system Leaks Water, below.<p>
