<h3>Air Conditioner Repair and Maintenance in Jamestown South Carolina</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the visit. They recommended changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost however a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was extremely pleased they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will absolutely be using them once again.<p>
<p>This is most likely the most typical question we hear.

Our technician will offer you an accurate cost with your options BEFORE any work begins. Each of our service technicians are well trained, experienced, drug tested and background inspected so that you can rest simple knowing your services will be performed in a professional and timely way.

<p>Reinstall the access panel and detach block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait for the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Startup," below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan must spin. If the compressor starts however the fan doesn't, the fan motor is probably shot. Shut down the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then see and repower the system if the fan begins. If  it doesn't, you've provided it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a colorless, odor free gas that interferes with the delivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can trigger unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can trigger a variety of symptoms from headaches, d izziness, weak point, confusion, nausea, and disorientation, to tiredness in healthy people and episodes of increased chest discomfort in people with chronic cardiovascular disease.
