<p>I am a real estate investor, I need to replace two furnaces in a 8000square foot house. Some sources, such as developing products, home furnishings and items like air fresheners, can release contaminants more or less continuously.

And, all of the cash you pay your energy utility companies on a monthly basis could be used to help you pay for a brand-new, much more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your recent heating costs with heating costs from the previous years. If there is a substantial difference, then it's time to change your furnace.<p>
