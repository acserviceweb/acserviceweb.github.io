<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace professionals often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be extreme. They consist of delays in psychological and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Infants, fetuses, and children are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults because lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the damaging impacts of lead. Kids may have higher direct exposures since they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
