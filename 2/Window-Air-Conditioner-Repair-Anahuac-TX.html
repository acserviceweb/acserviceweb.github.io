<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very helpful in gathering details on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to briefly deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day.

<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is often crucial to identifying the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such info can sometimes be gotten by requesting copies of air tracking data from the company. If monitoring data is not available, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union agent need to request that the company have air monitoring tests performed. Review of this information might recognize possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when pollutant concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on data might not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
