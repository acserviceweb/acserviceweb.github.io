<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate excellent but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
